               <p>Q. What do you know of this transaction? A. A person brought to our counting-house this letter, containing the bill of exchange I now hold in my hand; I do not know who the person was - the letter was wafered at the time; by the endorsement on the letter it appears to have been brought on the 9th of October, 1829, and I believe that to be the date - I did not see the prisoner after that till he was in custody about a fortnight ago; we did not make any advance on the bill, nor see the prisoner about it - my partner had before advanced him 500l. on a bill of lading; I am certain of his being the person who was at our house, although he had whiskers at that time, which he has not now, and he had no wig then - if he had, it was not one of the colour he has now; when I saw him at Lambeth-street his whiskers were shaved off, but I am quite sure he is the man, both from his tone of voice and his appearance.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the house of Fletcher and Co., and was so in October, 1829. I know the prisoner's person, and am quite positive of him - I saw him at the house previous to this transaction, but not subsequently till he was in custody; I never saw him write, but we have done business with him upon writing, which he acknowledged to be his - he called at our house the latter end of September, 1829, with a bill of lading, which had his endorsement on it, desiring the contents to be delivered over to our house, and 500l. was advanced on it; this enables me to form a judgment of the character of his hand-writing; (looking at the bill) I do not believe the bill to he his writing, nor the acceptance, but the endorsement I should say is his hand-writing; - I did not see him write when he presented the bill of lading; I never saw him write, but from my judgment from the endorsement to the bill of lading - I should say the letter which contained this bill was his hand-writing; I did not see him after the transaction about the bill of lading, till he was in custody - he was then very much altered in appearance; he had light hair when he called at our counting-house, and I considered that it was his own hair; he had a black wig on at the office, similar to what he has now, and he had very small light whiskers, which are now shaved off - I have not the least hesitation in swearing he is the man who I saw relative to the bill of lading.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you compare the hand-writing of the letter with the endorsement of the bill of lading? A. I have; my judgment remains the same - I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050004"/>not the least hesitation in saying positively it is your hand-writing, both the letter and the endorsement on the bill - I received the letter, and handed it over to Mr. Holl; I stood by him while he read it, and saw the bill taken out - I have not the slightest doubt it is the bill which was in that letter.</p>

I saw the prisoner at our counting-house, on the 30th of September, and early in October, 1829, relative to a professed shipment of goods - this was before the letter and bill arrived at our counting-house; I did not see him afterwards till he was in custody - I saw him sign and endorse the bill of lading, upon which I advanced 500l. - I have not a doubt upon my mind that the whole of the body of this bill of exchange is in the prisoner's handwriting; I do not know

               <p>Q. Look at the letter which contained the bill - does that letter appear to be in the hand-writing of the prisoner? A. It does; I have no doubt whatever that it is his hand-writing; I saw him endorse the bill of lading - I have seen him write twice, and have not a doubt of its being his writing: when I saw him in custody I knew him again immediately; he had the same black wig on as he has now, but at our counting-house he had rather light brown hair, and as far as I could judge it was his natural hair; I think I described him to the officers in 1829, as having whiskers, but do not recollect that - I remember the colour of his hair perfectly well; the bill of exchange is addressed to Robert Makin and Co., merchants, Liverpool; I do not know such persons myself; I have since seen Mr. Meyer, who was connected with them; the William is the ship the bill of lading alluded to; I believe the endorsement on the bill of exchange to be the prisoner's hand-writing - there is an endorsement on the bill in the name of Usher.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you try if there was such a person as Coates to be found? A. Yes, I found there was a Mr. Coates in St. Martin's-lane, but could not find him himself - he is subpoenaed here to-day: I never heard of your being at Havre, in France, nor any thing relative to an imposition being practised upon you in any shape whatever; I marked the bill, and know it again - it has been in our solicitor's hands part of the time; I did not advance any money on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of my having been latterly unwell? A. You applied to the Magistrate to be continued in the infirmary - I never heard of your having had a fever.</p>

               <p>The letter containing the bill was as follows:</p>
               <p>Brighton, Tuesday, 6th of October, 1829.</p>
               <p>GENTLEMEN, - With the hope of finding the William safely arrived by the time I return to London, which will be on Sunday or Monday next; I came to see this celebrated place, accompanied by a Mr. Usher, who is considerably engaged in trade in Dublin, and who I shall take the liberty of introducing to you; Mr. Coates, of St. Martin's-lane, who presents this letter, has kindly undertaken the trouble of paying for some things purchased by me in London, for which purpose I send the enclosed bill for 200l., for which I request you will be so good as to give a cheque on your bankers. No demand shall be made on you for money untill the bill be paid; my letters are directed"Post-office;" perhaps you would be good enough to take them into your care should there be any - shall make you an early call on my arrival in London. I am, Gentlemen, yours, &amp;c.</p>

I am clerk to Back-house and Co., of Liverpool, and was formerly clerk to Makin and Co., of Liverpool; I was their book-keeper in 1829, and know their hand-writing; there are only two partners - (looking at the bill) this acceptance is not the hand-writing of either of them; I have seen them write frequently for about thirty years, and am certain this was never written by either of them - I know no Mr. Anderton, of Berwick-on-Tweed; if they had a customer of that name, I must have known him - I never heard of such a person transacting business with them: we had no acquaintance whatever at Berwick-on-Tweed - I have known the prisoner nearly twenty years, and have not a doubt of his person; when I knew him he had lighter hair, and wore pretty long whiskers, of a light colour: when I saw him at the office he appeared as he does now - I knew him in Liverpool, and have frequently conversed with him; he knew me in Makin's office, and knew who they were - he never resided at Liverpool; his father did business with Makin, and lived at Sligo, in Ireland; the prisoner frequently came with him, and was introduced to our house by the father, who was in the corn trade; the firm was Morgan Macdonogh and Co.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect when my father ceased to do business with Makin and Co.? A. Fourteen or fifteen, or seventeen years ago; it is nearly twenty years ago that he was introduced by his father; the prisoner himself never did business with the house - I saw him occasionally in the streets of Liverpool, within two or three years ago, at different periods.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that I was acquainted with the banking-house where you made your bills payable? A. I cannot tell; we had one

            . I think I have known the prisoner about three years; I knew him in October, 1829 - I took a letter, by his direction, to the counting-house of Messrs. Fletcher and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the letter? A. I really cannot say; it was directed in the way this is - I took it by the prisoner's direction; I am not aware that he did any thing more, than desire me to take it to the counting-house - he, at that time, had more hair upon his face, and I think, if any thing, it was lighter than the hair he has now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hair on his head light or dark then? A. On my word I cannot say; I did not see him at the office, and do not think I have seen him since I witnessed an instrument for him, when he was in Whitecross-street prison, eight or nine months ago - I am perfectly satisfied of his person; I lived in St. Martin's-lane for many years - I have a warehouse there now, and had so in 1829.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How came you to take the letter? A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050005"/>On my word I do not know how I came to take it, but it strikes me I had the letter at Nightingale's, a tailor, who worked for him; I called there, and I believe he was there, and he might ask me if I was going into the City- I know I was going into the City.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know his hand-writing? A. Yes- I am satisfied the letter is in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I say to you when you took the letter? A. I really do not recollect; I am not aware of your desiring me to get any money from Mr. Fletcher - I heard you were under embarrassments about fifteen months ago; I never heard of Usher, of Dublin -I recollect your being arrested by Nightingale, a tailor, for about 40l.; you were in prison at his suit - I know Nightingale; I have got goods for him on credit in the City - I have known him about twenty years; you were released from prison on signing a deed of some property you have in Ireland - I witnessed your signature in prison; I am not aware that I signed any paper - this is my signature, (looking at a paper) - I never knew Usher of Dublin; the deed was signed six or eight months ago- I think you have been at my house once or twice during the last year, on a Sunday; I said I should certainly never injure any man if I could avoid it, but if called upon to answer questions about you, I should tell the truth; I was not at all aware of the transactions between Messrs. Fletcher and you, not in any shape - I might have heard it, but I do not take notice of other people's business; I think you once told me you were lodging at Bayswater - I do not recollect hearing of your living at No. 19, Downing-street; I never asked you to interfere in getting a peerage for a gentleman in Wales -I recollect I once called on you at Hill's hotel, Charing-cross; I unfortunately was bail for you - I took you from there and surrendered you; I knew a Mr. Dawson, a member of Parliament, who lived in Downing-street - I understood he was acquainted with you, but never knew you lived in his house; I have solicited votes for members for Westminster - I think I have had letters from you, but do not know where they are; I am satisfied the letter produced is your hand-writing - I do not know Mr. Addington, of Middleton-hall.</p>

            . In 1829 I was in the employ of Messrs. Denison and Co., bankers, London, and am so still. Messrs. Makin and Co. kept their accounts with Messrs. Haywood and Co., the Liverpool bank, and made their bills payable at our house; when Messrs.

Makin's at our house - I think this acceptance differs materially from what I have been accustomed to see, but from my ignorance of the party I should decline saying it was not their acceptance; it does not resemble their acceptances on which I have acted - I think, on looking over our books, we appear to have paid bills drawn on them by Anderton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, I am here a stranger - the circumstances of the case debar me from making any defence than what I could elicit from the gentlemen present; as to their swearing to my hand-writing, you, of course, will judge, and as to Coates I was not aware he would have been here, or I could have let you see the character of that man - he caused me to be arrested after coming from France, and being plundered by a man named Usher; Mr. Fletcher wrote to Ireland respecting Usher, and got a letter giving him the character of that man, and he read it at the office; I know Coates and Usher were very intimate - he will not acknowledge he knew Mr. Addington, about whom he bothered me exceedingly, by saying he wanted a peerage, that he had the interest of the Marquis of Conyngham, but could not get the Duke of Wellington; and he will not acknowledge where I lived, though he knew perfectly well - I have been entirely deceived by Usher; he went to America from Havre, in France, where I followed him, to try to recover money he had from me - the newspapers have spread reports of my being a swindler, to prejudice my case, of my having swindled people at the west end of the town, but not a single person has come forward against me; I lived at No. 89, Regent-street, up to the time I was apprehended - I am an utter stranger here, and can have no witnesses; as to Coates, many persons know he is as hardened as a stone; he is a perfect Judas, and has been told by a Judge, that the next time he came into a Court he had better take care, for he perjured himself then; an apothecary at Westminster, named Cowan, knows he is connived with a notorious character on elections, named Stanbury - I hope your Lordship will think of my unfortunate situation, being subject to the reproach of a villain, who commenced with Nightingale to rob me of my property, and I was obliged to sign a deed, through terror and fear of him, subject to a sale if I did not pay my debts in six months; he is well known in London as a notorious fellow, and he signed this paper that I should be in no danger (reads), "Mr. McDonogh has given me a deed of trust, executed by him to Mr. Nightingale, which I engage to return, in the event of his being arrested on any account whatever before he reaches Mr. Nightingale's house;" Davis and Co., their attornies, would not be concerned for them, and they employed another; I am well aware of the influential body I have to do with, and am sorry they have gone about slandering me even in the prison I am in - I wish to ask Mr. Fletcher when he was at Exley's office, in Devon - shire-square.</p>
               <p>MR. FLETCHER. I know these parties as prosecutors on another indictment - I was never at their counting-house in person; I have made no inquiry about your property - I have heard something about title-deeds, but have no reason to believe you have any property whatever; I sent my attorney to make inquiry about you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There are several letters of mine in the hands of Exley and Co., which might be produced - I trust the Jury will consider whether the bill is my handwriting.</p>

               <p>MARY PRATT. In 1829 I lived at No. 8, Charterhouse-street. To the best of my belief the prisoner paid me these four notes - he lodged and boarded with me for four or five months; I made a small cross on them, which I find here, and believe these crosses to have been made by me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I very ill at your house? A. Yes, for, I think, eight or nine weeks - I do not recollect any body visiting you but Mr. Stevenson; I was perfectly satisfied with your conduct - you paid me every thing before you left.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he stay some time at your house after his illness? A. Yes; he did not lose his hair - I think it was a lighter colour than he has now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not obliged to have my hair cut off, to have leeches applied? A. I recollect some of your hair being cut off for leeches; you complained very much of your head, and I think had a blister at the back of it, but there was no appearance of a loss of hair when he recovered.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I feel for Mr. Fletcher's loss, and am very sorry for it: I was made the dupe of a man who came here after leaving another country, and was prowling about with a considerable sum of money, with one Allen, a Scotchman; they travelled together, and invented all this - he called on me in Downing-street, and asked me to let him use my name and firm, he having failed; I trust you will consider what I have offered in my defence has not been done from hardened feelings - I regret the loss exceedingly; I have often blamed people in London for being suspicious, as I did not know what a place it was, but from my experience since I have been committed, I cannot blame any body; I never thought such vice could exist - I have been made the dupe of a vile man, who is now in New York; at the time the bill of lading was delivered I was not aware of its being an imperfect instrument till Usher went to America - I then became aware of it, and was on my guard, fearing I should be arrested. -Mr. Fletcher cannot state whether the bill of lading is my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050007"/>hand-writing; if the stamp is an English one, it is not a legal instrument - if I had known it was forged I should never have paid for my lodging; I did not know the goods were not shipped by Usher.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written) From an early period in life I have been in the services of gentlemen of wealth and consequence in town and country, and not being able to obtain an engagement for these last nine months. I have been reduced to the greatest vicissitudes, and, as it is customary for young men seeking situations to call at taverns, where vacancies are made known; on my occasionally calling at one of them, I most unhappily became acquainted with a young man, who, being unemployed, frequently staid all night at my lodgings, and by whose persuasions I was weakly induced to consent to become his participator, and I have neither heard of or seen him since my apprehension. Until this misfortune befel me no blemish has stained my character, and the miseries of poverty alone prompting me to listen to the evil voice of deviation from the paths of rectitude; I most humbly implore your merciful consideration.</p>

I have seen the prisoner twice at my stables - he had hired a cart on a former occasion, and I sent my man with him; I saw him again in about a fortnight or three weeks, before he hired the chaise. On Saturday, the 18th of February, about a quarter-past nine o'clock in the morning, he came alone, and said he wanted a horse and chaise to go to Carshalton; I asked if a light cart would not answer his purpose - he said No, he was going to take a female with him, and a chaise would be more respectable; I said as he wished a chaise he should have one - he wished it for five hours, and was to pay 18s. - I gave him the duty-ticket, and he went away with a chaise worth 20l., a gelding worth 20l., harness worth 3l., a horsecloth and whip - I delivered them to him; he was to return that afternoon - none of my servants went with him; I asked him for a deposit - he said he had no money till he went to Carshalton, where he should see his uncle, who resided there, and he should receive some money from him; I have never seen the chaise and horse since- I inquired on the following Monday, at the Marsh-gate, to see if he had delivered the ticket; I could learn nothing of the chaise or horse - I did not see him again till he was in the custody of Goddard, on the 22nd of March.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe I told you I was going to an aunt of mine at Carshalton? A. No, to an uncle; you only hired them for five hours - I was to have no more if he kept it that day; I said I would not mind an hour or two, if he would not distress the horse - I never let you a horse more than twice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know where he lived? A. He gave his address at his mother's, in Alfred-street, Bedford-square; I believe she deals in ladies' wardrobes - I went there, and found he had not lived there for six months; the officer is not here, as no property was found on him - I have heard nothing of my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I surrendered myself to Goddard- I hired the horse and gig for a young man named Harrison, a veterinary surgeon, who lived in Brook-street, Regent's-park, who was going to see his aunt at Carshalton; I took the responsibility, and hired it as for myself - I left him in the Hampstead-road, to go to Carshalton; he met me in the evening, and said he had but half a sovereign, to pay the expences - I did not like to take it home with that money, and told him to take the horse and gig home to the prosecutor's, to pay the half-sovereign, and say I would make it up in a few days; he met me on Sunday, and promised to meet me on Monday, which he did - he appeared confused; I asked what was the matter, and he acknowledged he had not taken the horse and chaise home, but if I would meet him in the evening, he would fetch them and take them home with compensation for the time he had had it; I called at the Belvidere, Islington, at six o'clock, but he never came - I went out of town, and wrote to the prosecutor, proposing to pay by monthly instalments, but received no answer, and in about a fortnight surrendered to meet the charge; I told Goddard the particulars.</p>

               <p>SIR, - I have no doubt you feel much surprised you have not heard from me, respecting your horse and gig, before this time, but, under the circumstances, I know not which course it might he most prudent to adopt; when I borrowed the gig, I must admit, I said it was for myself - however, to speak the truth, I borrowed it for another young man, to whom I entrusted it to return to you, when he promised me he would do so, and adjust the difference incurred for its use, and he further promised to meet me the following day, Sunday, which he did, when he told me he had drove it into the Country, and, being pushed for money to pay his passage to Scotland, had parted with it there; to this I held out threats, when he promised me if I would meet him at nine o'clock the next morning, Monday, he would get it returned him, and deliver it to me, with 2l. for its use; I was at the appointed place, when a youth, waiting there by his desire, told me he could not get it back, and, therefore, had started for Edinburgh: under these circumances, I know not how to act, and, therefore, I wish to make the following proposition, which is all the remuneration it lays in my power to make- that is, by an agreement, signed and stamped, to pay 30s. per month - the first payment down, and the rest at the expiration of every month, until the value of the horse and gig be paid, which, considering how I am situated, ought to be set down at the lowest price - I must then endeavour to get into business, that I may be able to fulfil what I engage to do; and if you will so far oblige, as to let my mother know all particulars, and tell her the overture I make, I dare say she would favour me so far<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050009"/>as to recieve any decisive answer you might make to what I have proposed; if she refuses this, I shall feel obliged for a note left for C.R.S.H., Post-office, Gerrard-street, Soho: should she have no objection, a person shall call for your reply in writing, when it will reach me the following day; and I trust, as a sincere favour, you will forward it as speedily as possible.</p>

On the 18th of March I was on the road to Hammersmith, at half-past four o'clock in the morning - I met three men; they were coming in an opposite direction, but met me at the corner of the lanc - they came from a different road into the road where I was; one of them said, "Good morning to you;" which I returned - I walked on; they joined my company immediately, and were with me about five minutes - then they got behind me, and in about a minute they came up to me, one of them on my left side, and one on my right, and one kept a short distance behind me - they walked with me a considerable distance; one of the three, who was dressed in a black surtout coat and black trousers, took my watch out of my pocket, and one who gave his name James Boswell, struck me at the same time on my right arm, and exclaimed, "D-n you, where are you going?" and knocked me down - the one who drew my watch out ran across the fields, and the other two went in another direction; I lost sight of Boswell and the other - I followed the one who had my watch, but could not overtake him; I am sure Boswell is the man who struck me on the right arm - it was just break of day: the man who took my watch was of a very dark complexion, and very much pitted with the small-pox - he wore a black surtout coat and dark trousers; I saw Hancock at Hatton-garden on Monday last, and twice before that - the first time was the Saturday after the robbery, which happened on a Sunday; he was very much marked with the small-pox, and I thought he was the man, but he was not dressed the same way then.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. You have no means of knowing Hancock, except by his being marked with the small-pox? A. That is all - I do not swear to him; it was a very star-light morning, sufficient to see that the man was marked with the small-pox - the watch was gone before I was struck; they were all three marked with the small-pox.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Sunday, the 18th of March, about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner Hancock with another man named Thomas or James Boswell, (not the other prisoner) at the Green Dragon-yard, Holborn - I met a stranger in Holborn, who took me there; I went up to Hancock, and asked if he had not a watch in his possession - he told me he had, and that it was his own property; he took it out of his pocket, and gave it into my hands - I asked how he came by it; he said his mother gave it to him - he did not say when; he said his uncle, who lived in the house against which he was standing, would satisfy me the watch was his property; I told him he and the other must go with me to the station-house, to satisfy the inspector - they went willingly with me; I afterwards inquired if his uncle lived at the house, and found he did not - I was told so: they were afterwards taken before Mr. Laing, the Magistrate - Hancock was detained, and the other discharged; Hancock offered to leave the watch with me before I left the Green Dragon-yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050010"/>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you the particular house his uncle lived in? A. The house he was standing against; it was not a pawnbroker's shop - he said his uncle's name was Brown; Mr. Brown did not live at that house - it is a respectable looking house; I inquired if there were any lodgers, and was told no such person lived there.</p>
               <p>EDMUND DAVIS. I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner Boswell on the 26th of March, in bed, at No. 43, Charles-street, Drury-lane, in consequence of information, on suspicion of this robbery - I asked if he knew a person named Hancock; he said No - I told him to dress, and asked where his brother was: he said he had no brother - I said nothing to him about the watch then, but at the station-house he was asked about the watch, and said he knew nothing about it; I was before Mr. Laing, but did not hear the prisoner say any thing; I do not know Mr. Laing's hand-writing.</p>

On the 29th of February, between three and four o'clock, I saw a hackney-coach stop right opposite my master's door, at Lambeth; I saw Graham get out of the coach, and go over to Higginbottom's, the pawnbroker, twice, with some things - the coachman was on the box; there was a young woman in the coach - I did not see her face: Jones was also in the coach - I am quite sure of him; Jones got on the top of the box afterwards, and rode round the corner; they went away - Graham had a bundle, which she took to Higginbottom's, and when she came back the second time she had a bundle in her apron again - she went back into the coach.</p>

On the evening of the 26th of March, about a quarter-past nine o'clock, I heard an alarm of thieves; I ran out, and saw the prisoner running - I pursued him about three hundred yards, and took him, without losing sight of him; I took him into a shop at the corner of the street, and a Policeman came up - I gave him to him; he searched him, and found this seal in his jacket pocket - I had seen it on a card in our window about a quarter of an hour before; the window was then whole - I heard a noise just before the alarm was given, but did not know what it was: when I came back I found a square of glass broken near where the seal was; it would admit a hand - it was plate glass: the door was open at the time, and Mrs. Telfer in the shop; I know the seal to be master's - the prisoner was running - he turned up a court by the side of the house; nothing else was missing - our shop had four gas-lights in it.</p>

            . On the 11th of December I and Seth went to the Bell public-house; the prisoner came in and drank with us - he spoke to Seth, and then spoke to me; he told me Mrs. Cole was out, and asked if I and Seth would go with him, and break Mrs. Cole's house open; he proposed to meet in the evening, and we all met that evening at the Queen's Head, between five and six o'clock, staid there some time, then went to the Two Sawyers, and then to the Bells, where we stopped till about ten minutes past twelve o'clock - during that time Seth had spoken to Kite about going, and we all four came away - Davis and I went through the church-yard, and stopped for Kite and Seth; we then proceeded to Mrs. Cole's house - we sat in the summer-house till we heard the watchman call half-past twelve o'clock - Seth then went and attempted to break in at the back of the house, but not gaining an entrance he came to the front parlour window, and opened it; we all came up to him - he wrenched the bar of the shutter -Davis, Seth, and Kite went inside; I waited outside, and in about two hours they brought some parcels out to me; they then went into the house again, and had not been in long before their light went out - they came out, and got another light, went back, and came out with the barometer and other articles; the articles produced were brought out to me - I put them in the summer-house till we all came away together, and took them to the Queen's Head stable: Davis went with us; I saw Webb in about five minutes - the things were then about the stable; part of them stood outside the stable door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written,) I humbly throw myself on your mercy, and implore your humano consideration of these circumstances, which are the truth. On the Saturday night the robbery took place, I was at the Eight Bells, at Twickenham, till eleven o'clock - I drank more than I ought, and on getting home found the door fastened, and went to a barge belonging to Mr. Kerby; on going over a plank to the harge, I slipped into the water, and laid all night in the cabin in wet clothes - I went home in the morning, and about four o'clock was wiping my wet stockings when the watchman came up; I returned to the barge, finding it was so early - I then went into Hampshire to work at my sister's; I do not know why Bunce should accuse me of the robbery, except from a knowledge that I was not in my father's house that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to THOMAS BUNCE. Q. Did you not sell the plate? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man who bought it give you 5l. 10s. for it? A. I never had a farthing of the property.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 27th of February, a little before eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in Brunswick-square, and saw the prisoners in company together, going from door to door, with scouring-paper; I suspected, and followed them round into Henrietta-street, Brunswick-square, and saw them try the area gates - they came to the bottom of the street, and I observed them both tie their two rolls of scouring-paper into one parcel, and Milliner put it under his arm; I saw them try the lock of the gate, No. 1, Henrietta-street, and saw Sly go down into the area, after opening the gate - I do not know which opened it; they were close together- Milliner walked to and fro; I observed him beckon to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050013"/>Sly, and then saw him push the area gate open, which had drawn to; he reached his body inside, and took something up out of the area - I could not see from whom he took it; it looked like a dark bundle - Sly then immediately came up, and crossed the street away from Milliner; I crossed over, and collared Milliner - I felt his bundle, and found it was silver; Sly immediately ran off - I called Stop thief! he was near enough to see me take Milliner; I have the bundle I took from Milliner - it contains four table, five dessert, and six tea-spoons, two ladles, a fish and a butter-knife, five forks and two salt-spoons; Sly was taken in about two minutes - I never lost sight of him; he was getting over a fence, and a boy held him till I came up - he said to me, "I don't know that man, I never saw him before in my life" (meaning Milliner); he had the plate in a japanned bread-tray.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Sly was taken in about two minutes, had you looked at the bundle before he was taken? A. No - I chinked it, and found it was plate; I was looking round at Sly - he never got out of my sight; he was the only one running in the street, but when I cried Stop thief! about two more persons ran- nobody told me I was mistaken in Sly's person; he was never out of my sight - the house is in St. Pancras parish.</p>

I know this plate to be his; I had the care of it, and had seen it ten minutes before the alarm, in the pantry in front of the house, in the bread-tray; there was a curtain before the window - nobody could see it; I was on the second floor at the time - there was no servant below; there are only four in family - I saw the prisoners about the premises two or three days before, both of them - they were standing looking steadfastly down the area when I was coming down stairs about ten o'clock in the morning; I saw them through the half window - our area gate was locked at this time; it is never open; there are no steps - he must have jumped down seven or eight feet I should think; the kitchen door was on the latch - a person below could reach any thing up to a person who was stooping down; I had been up stairs about ten minutes - a gentleman knocked at the door, and gave an alarm; I found the plate gone, and the doors all left open - the house door was latched before, and shut, but not locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The area is seven or eight feet deep? A. It is; the door of the coal-cellar being pulled open, any person might climb up it - there are ledges on the inside of the door; the door is three or four feet high - there are no iron bars; I cannot tell whether the cellar-door was open - it is never locked; the area rails are four or five feet high, with spikes at the top.</p>
               <p>Milliner's Defence. I was going about my business, and on coming by the area there was a lad down there; it was no the prisoner; he asked me to give him a help up- I asked how he came there; he said the servant had been giving him some bread, and said "Here it is" - I took it up, and the officer immediately took me.</p>
               <p>Sly's Defence. I was walking along, selling pincushions, and coming from a door, where I had just sold the last; when I came out a mob was hallooing Stop thief! I ran before them, and this man came up to me, and said, "That is him, stop him before he gets over the paling" - they were looking over the paling, thinking the boy had got over, and he said, "That is the boy who gave him the silver."</p>

On Friday evening, the 30th of March, about seven o'clock, I saw a man, in company with another, looking through the window; I believe it was the prisoner Whitehall who was looking, and on being observed by me, they both walked away - Whitehall shortly returned, and a person came into the shop; in consequence of what he said, our young man went out in pursuit - he returned without seeing anybody; I examined the window, and missed a gold neck-chain which I had seen the day before hanging in the window - 
I had not noticed it that day; I found the corner of a square of glass, about the centre of the window, which was cracked before, was pushed in - the putty must have been loosened by some instrument and the piece pushed in or broken; I saw the piece laying inside - it had fallen on some seals and cracked; the space was sufficiently large to admit two fingers - I had observed the window that afternoon about five o'clock; the piece was not out then - ours is a double window; Farrant, the officer, came on the Monday, and produced a gold neck 
chain, which I knew to be ours.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You believe Whitehall to be the man who looked in at the window? A. Yes, the alarm was given about five minutes past seven o'clock; I had been in the shop for a quarter of an hour, but heard nothing to attract my attention - I heard no glass fall: it was fastened with very old putty, and was very firm - ours is a noisy neighbourhood; a great many carriages pass.</p>

On Friday, the 30th of March, a young man came to our shop- I cannot form a judgment of who he was; he came within a few minutes of half-past seven o'clock, and produced a gold neck-chain - I did not buy it then; he came a second time, and 1 weighed it - it was 2 ozs. 6 grs.; I bought it of him at 50s. an ounce, which is the value of the gold - it came to 5l. 1s.; that is the value, independent of the fashion and make; he was alone - I paid him a 5l. bank note and a shilling; I should know the note again - it was No. 26,908, dated the 17th of February; Farrant, the officer, came into my shop in less than two minutes after the transaction, and immediately went out after the man - he came again, and I delivered him the chain.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Friday afternoon, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw both the prisoners in company together in Princes-street, Leicester-square, walking up and down the street several times; and suspecting, I watched them - I observed Whitehall cross the road towards Smart's shop; I did not see him go in, but lost sight of him for a few minutes - he returned to Rogers; they then walked up the street together several times, then came and stood in front of Smart's shop, on the opposite side, for a minute or two; I then saw Whitehall cross the road and go into Smart's shop - Rogers remained on the opposite side; Whitehall came out in a few minutes, and joined Rogers again - they both went up Princes-street; I then went into Smart's, and made inquiry, then went after them, and watched them into a public-house at the corner of Compton-street, and went for assistance - when I returned they had just gone out into Wardour-street, where I saw them both in company; they turned round, saw me, and separated - I secured Whitehall, and gave him into custody, then went in pursuit of Rogers, and took him in Pulteney-street; I took them to St. Ann's watch-house, and on searching Whitehall, I found three sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, two shillings, and a knife, which is used for cutting glass - it is cut off sharp at the point; I have found many of them on prisoners who were in the habit of starring the glaze - I went to Smart's in about a quarter of an hour, and got the chain; I went to the public-house I had watched them to, and Ann Glandfield produced a note to me - I took the number of it, and left it in her possession.</p>

               <p>John Druitt. Q. What information did you receive, that made you search my house? A. A report in the neighbourhood that there were two sacks carried in, and the neighbours thought there were two dead bodies in the house - I found the duplicates on Reeve after I returned from the watch-house, and after we had taken the things from the house - she declared they were her own property; I believe she is Druitt's mother.</p>
               <p>Reeve. I picked them off the floor, and put them under my stays.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was with Ashton on the night of the 5th of March, and assisted in searching the prisoner's house, at No. 7, Grove-place - I found an opera-glass in a little basket in a box, in the upper room, and a jemmy - there are only two rooms; there was one bedstead, which turns up, and another bed on the floor - as I was taking the male prisoner to the station people were hooting after him; I said, "You see they still suppose you to be a body-snatcher;" he said, "I wish it was no worse."</p>
               <p>John Druitt. Q. Were there not other things with the opera-glass, such as gloves, which you took away? A. There were; I did not at first take the opera-glass till after I had been to the station; it remained there when I returned, but a watch, which laid by the side of it, was gone - I was never at the house before; I asked Druitt about certain property which I found there - he said it had been brought to him only that morning by two young men, who asked him to take care of it, as they were afraid of getting into trouble about it - he could not tell me their names or address, this did not relate to the property in question.</p>

On Sunday night, the 4th of March, I made my house secure; I locked and bolted the doors, as usual, and the windows were fastened; next morning I found the warehouse had been entered at the back, and from there they got into the shop, which is part of the dwelling-house, and under the same roof; the shop and warehouse is on one floor, and are not divided; they are all one room - I had gone to bed about twelve o'clock, and was the last person up; I came down at four o'clock in the morning, being alarmed, and found the street door had been opened inside; they had entered at the ware-house, the casement of which was broken, and part of the inside shutter was broken and open; there was a hole in the window large enough for a man to get through - the shutter had been put up again: I missed 1 cwt. of tobacco, and 25 lbs, of cigars, worth 53l. together, and 10l. in 5s. papers of copper, which I had tied up myself; I saw it afterwards, and knew it to be mine; I have seen some of the tobacco since - I lost four bags.</p>

            . On Monday, the 5th of March, I went with another officer, to the prisoner's premises, about half-past eight o'clock at night; I did not find the male prisoner at home - I knocked at the door; a voice asked who was there: I said, "Open the door," and it was opened by Reeve - she screamed violently at seeing strangers, and said she could not open it without shutting it, as her foot was under it; I pushed it open, went up stairs, and on the stairs found a quantity of 5s. papers of halfpence piled up - I have them here; I went up stairs, and the room was strewed about with a great quantity of gloves, tobacco. and skeleton-keys; I asked Reeve if any young men had brought any thing there that morning - she said No, that no young men were in the habit of coming there at all; there were forty-eight keys in all, not all skeletons - there was a dark-lantern found in the back kitchen, and the inspector found a small crow-bar.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050017"/>John Druitt Q. Did you not say the halfpence must have been laying there some time, as they were covered with dust? A. The papers were nearly all broken; I said I thought they must have laid there longer than the morning, but the bags would cover them with dust in a moment; I had not received information of this robbery; Reeve said the money was theirs, and they used it as they wanted it - I found a cash-box there, which has not been owned, and a life protector, also a new method of getting a light in a moment, and here are keys which will open the smallest places; Reeve said her son had been an ironmonger, and made the keys when in business - the skeleton-keys were in a bag on the mantel-piece in the upper room: there are 5l. 19s. in copper - there were three phosphorus-boxes.</p>


               <p>JOHN BUSAIN. I am an inspector of the Police. I assisted in searching the house, and apprehending the prisoners, on the evening of the 5th of March; I found two sacks up stairs, and a jemmy, which I applied to Mrs. Kemp's desk, which was broken open, and found it exactly corresponded with the marks on it - one part is rather shorter than at the other end; it appeared to have been done by that instrument - Druitt and his wife were out at the time; I apprehended the wife.</p>
               <p>John Druitt. Q. After you called me out of the station-house several times, what account did I give of the property found? A. That it had all been brought by two young men; I alluded particularly to the gloves.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Broad-street, St. Giles', on Monday morning, about half-past two o'clock, and saw the male prisoner standing at the end of a court; Mrs. Kemp's house is at the corner of that court - I saw him there for nearly an hour, from half-past two till half-past three; I kept going round my beat, and saw him there again before four; I asked what his business was - he said he was waiting there for a cabdriver, who was in the habit of coming to a corn-chandler's shop there, as he wanted him to give him a ride home, as he lived in the neighbourhood of Finsbury-square; I came back about four, and he was then gone -I saw a backney-coach drive up to the stand a little before four o'clock, and it was gone when I missed him; in about ten minutes I discovered that Mrs. Kemp's house was broken open - I have not a doubt of his person; there is a coach-stand right opposite her house.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Broad-street, St. Giles', on the night in question, from nine o'clock in the evening till six in the morning - I saw the male prisoner about half-past two o'clock, standing at the end of the court, within a foot of the prosecutrix's front door; I have not a doubt of him - it was a very stormy wet night; he had an umbrella under his arm, and appeared a respectable man; I thought he was standing out of the rain, and did not remove him.</p>
               <p>MRS. KEMP. I tied up these halfpence myself, and know them to be mine, and here are two sacks - my son's hand-writing is on this paper bag of tobacco.</p>
               <p>John Druitt's Defence. The things were all brought to me by Williams on the day in question, and the information given was that two persons were seen to bring the bags into my house; I have witnesses who saw me open my shutter at seven o'clock in the morning, before the things were brought - I met Williams on the previous Saturday night; he asked me to let him leave some things at my house on the Monday morning, as he was afraid of their being seized for rent - these things are what he brought; where he is I cannot ascertain.</p>
               <p>JAMES -. On the 12th of March I was taken into custody in the New-road, by this Policeman, with my son, as I was going home from the London-docks - I was locked up twenty-three hours, then brought up, and saw Druitt at Clerkenwell on the 13th of March, but never before: when I was in the yard the turnkey ordered us all to stand up - several people came in to identify parties - some person said, "That is the man in the fustain jacket," meaning Druitt.</p>
               <p>John Druitt. They said, "That is Druitt, the man in the fustian jacket," and after being pointed out it was easy to identify me.</p>

The prisoner lodged at my house for a month, and on the 21st of February, about ten o'clock in the morning, I left this property safe in my box in my bed-room - I returned at eight o'clock at night, found my box in the middle of the room, and all these things gone; the prisoner was also gone, and never returned - he left his working clothes behind him; he had given no notice to leave - he boarded with me, and worked for my mistress; I did not see him again till he was apprehended - the property is worth more than 5l.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. On Tuesday night, the 13th of March, I met the prisoner in Hereford-street, Lisson-grove, and said I wanted him; he said, "What for?" - I told him for stealing a quantity of wearing-apparel from Paddington; he said "Come along,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050018"/>let us go and settle it" - I knocked at my own door in Hereford-street, and asked for the inventory, and read over to him all the articles stated in the indictment; he said he had only got 14s. for the lot, and 3s. 6d. for the watch - I asked where he had pawned it; he said, at Harrison's, in Tottenham-court-road - I went there, and Meagle said there was no watch pawned for 3s. 6d.; it was produced on the 16th and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me it would be better for me to confess? A. No such thing; I knew his friends so well, I took pity on him - I have known him some years; he was going to tell me more, but I would not hear him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I left my old clothes with his wife for a week's lodging.(Watch produced and sworn to)</p>

On the 21st of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, my boy rang me down; I found the prisoner in the shop - my lad said he wanted a morning-ring; I turned the gas on full, unlocked the case, and looked out a card containing six or eight morning-rings, which I gave him - he took them out of my hand, and walked to the door, (which was open.) as I supposed to look at them; he immediately ran out with them - I told my lad to run out and cry Stop thief! I had to go round the counter, and should have left nobody in the shop if I had gone myself; he was brought back in about an hour or three quarters - I saw him at the office next morning, and swore positively to him; I am now sure he is the man, but will not swear it - he had his hat on then; I am confident of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Do you swear positively to him? A. No, but I am sure he is the man; he was brought back to my shop that evening, and I knew him then - there was not less than six rings, nor more than eight; one of them was worth 3l. - the weight of the gold was 1l. value, but it was an expensive pattern.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If there were only six, what would the value be? A. Not less than 5l. 10s. or 6l.; I should have sold them for about 8l. - he was searched in my shop, and a shop-ticket taken from him, with my handwriting on it.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Were there not several other tickets about your shop at the time? A. Yes, but not on that part; they were at the end of the counter - I saw the Policeman take it from him, and lay it on the counter; they had been cleared away before he was searched.</p>

I went with the constable, in about three quarters of an hour, to the Pavilion, and saw the prisoner there, just at the back entrance to the gallery - he was coming out; I gave him in charge of Lewsey - I saw him searched at master's shop, and saw the card taken from his pocket, with some money; Lewsey put it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the shop all the time? A.

               <p>GILES CLEMENTS. I live at North-end, Fulham - I knew Tomlin well, and knew Shipton by sight. On Saturday, the 10th of March, I was at a public-house with them - I was there from between nine and ten o'clock till near twelve; they were not there all that time - we came away together, and as I was going along in front of them they were talking to me; I was thrown down on my head, and nearly stunned - one of them got on me; they got off, and in two minutes I found I was robbed of two half-crowns, five shillings, and a tobacco-pouch - nobody but the prisoners were near; I was quite sober - I do not know which of them was on me; it was in <placeName id="t18320405-17-crimeloc120">Brooke's-alley</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When first asked by the Magistrate did you know what coins you had? A. I said there was a half-crown or two among it; I now remember there were two - I have known Tomlin three years, and knew he lived in Star-lane, but I did not understand how to go to work to have them taken, till my master told me - I think I told him about it on the Wednesday; there were some women in Tomlin's company, but not in mine - I did not drink with them; I called for half-and-half - Tomlin asked if he might drink; I said he might - I turned my head, and then my beer was emptied into his pot.</p>

I was at the Wheatsheaf on the 3rd of March, and saw the prosecutor there, between ten and eleven o'clock, sitting down drinking half-and-half with two girls; he changed a half-crown in my sight - I left him there about a quarter-past twelve o'clock; he was very much in liquor indeed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he able to walk? A. He could walk, and that was all - he told me on the Sunday morning that he had been playing at dominoes at the Cock before.</p>

On the 24th of October the prisoner, who was a stranger, came about nine o'clock, and engaged a bed; he went to bed in the top room, about eleven o'clock, and paid 1s. 6d. for the bed that night - he went away next morning, about seven o'clock; I went up to the room about ten, and missed a frock-coat, which was tied in brown paper, and put into the cupboard of the room he slept in; a gentleman had left it in my care - I missed from my box,in the opposite room to his, three gowns and the other things; I slept in that room, and am sure I closed the door when I left, but did not lock it - the things were taken after I got up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were you the chambermaid? A. Yes - we had no other lodger that night; I never saw the prisoner before - he came to me in the morning, and asked if he could have a bed again that night; I said Yes - he said he would come back about two and let me know; I was the only female servant, and my room is on the second floor - it was fastened with a spring latch; I polled it too, but did not lock it - I have found nothing but a piece of my gown.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he come back, as he said he would? A. No.</p>
               <p>ROBERT EARRINGTON. I rent the house. I recollect the prisoner sleeping there on the 24th of October, and am quite certain of him; I got up at half-past seven o'clock, but did not go into the servant's room at all; I have not a doubt of the prisoner's person - we had no other lodger that night; I saw the prisoner at the Mansion-house about a month ago - he is the man, although he has trimmed his whiskers; he had whiskers down to his neckcloth when at my house - he has now very small ones; they were the same at the Mansion-house as when I saw him at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he a stranger to you? A. Perfectly so; I know nobody had been up stairs the morning he left, as they must pass my room.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you attend on him? A. I did - he had a pint or two of porter, and I waited on him.</p>

            . I am chambermaid at the hotel. On the 30th of January the prisoner slept there - I am certain of him; he slept at No. 12, on the same floor as Mr. Webb - he went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock; I took his candle up, and asked if I should take his carpet-bag: he would not let me - I saw him in the morning, coming out of his bed-room door, and have not a doubt of him; he had large whiskers then: I saw him again when he was brought to the house - his whiskers were not removed then; that has been done since; I was sweeping his room in the course of the day, and found a quantity of cabbage-leaves and young cabbages under the bed; they would fill his carpet-bag - if they had been there when I lighted him up, I must have seen them.</p>

               <p>MR. WEBB. These articles are mine, I am certain; I left my portmanteau locked, and when I returned the lock appeared to have been hampered - the end of it was ripped up, and the things dragged out; it appeared prized open; this shaving-case is worth 1l.</p>

I borrowed on Monday;" I then went to a case at the back of the ware-house - he and I opened it, and I took a bottle out and gave him; he assisted to close the case, and put the bottle of wine behind him: I then told him to come and lock up- the keys were missing, and have never been found; I had given them to Crew a few minutes before; I said,"Very likely they are wrapped in that towel Edward has taken out, I'll go and see;" Smith said, "There is nothing in the towel but the bottle of wine I have bought of you;" I said, "How can that be? there is that bottle of wine;" I went to the public-house with Crew, and asked for the towel he had left there - I found in it a bottle of wine, with my seal on it; I returned to the warehouse, and asked the prisoner how he could act so - he went on his knees, and begged forgiveness; I gave him in charge, and next morning Crew's father and mother brought him to me, and he gave me information respecting another bottle of wine which I also found at the public-house; the seal was broken off that - they were two quart bottles - it was Steyne wine, and all taken out of one case.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the Police. I found these veneers in the prisoner's right-hand jacket pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. BARTHOLOMEW. I know these by their being cut from some long pieces in my possession; they have been cut as if to do some work which he had at his lodging - I missed two long pieces, Nos. 34 and 35.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you mean to say they were cut out of two veneers? A. It is most likely; here is rather more than two veneers, but I know I missed two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They are not his at all; they are the ends of several veneers.</p>

I was present when the prisoner unlocked her box with a key which she pulled out of her pocket - these duplicates, this handkerchief, and this napkin, were found in it; there was no duplicate found in the kitchen - she said she got the duplicates from a woman, instead of some money, and the towel and handkerchief, she said came there by washing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the housemaid had been inquiring the value of the spoon, that the duplicate of it was sold to her, by a woman who came to the house to buy old clothes.</p>
               <p>MR. CHITTY. My other servant is here, and has been with me a long time - I am positive the duplicate was in her box; she came to me with a false written character - I have ascertained she is a labourer's wife.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the night of the 27th of February I was on duty at Ebury-terrace; there is a grove of trees in front of it - I saw the prisoner going along about half-past ten o'clock, with this cheese on his head; I hailed him to stand; he took no notice, and I ran after him - he was then about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's; I asked where he brought it from; he said it was no business of mine, and it was very odd that men could not go about their lawful business without such busy fellows interfering with them - I then asked where he was taking it to; he said, "Home," but I could get no account that was satisfactory; he mentioned a street, but he was going in quite a contrary direction - I said he should tell me where it came from; he would not, and I took him to the watch-house - he swore, and said, "You may have the cheese, that will be of some use, but I am of no use;" I said I would not part with the cheese nor him; he then said he would not carry it, and I was not aware it was so heavy as it is - he then threw it towards me, struck at me, and broke from me; I parried off the blow, and took hold of him; we had a hard struggle before I could draw my rattle; when I sprang it, two of my brother officers came, and we took him; he then said he had found the cheese in that grove - I made enquiries, and found the prosecutor, and the shopman swore to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not ask where the other two men in the white apron, and the basket were, and say if I could tell you where they were, you would let me go? Witness. No, I did not say I would let you go; I asked where the other two men were - there were three together at first, and I disturbed them; I then saw them again in a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner had the cheese - I found the basket afterwards, but nothing in it.</p>

On the 23rd of March the prisoner came to our house, with a note and a pattern of linen - she said she came from Lady Auckland, of Grosvenor-street, for some more of the same linen as they had last week - I am not aware that they had had any the week before, but in consequence of the note, I sold her the articles stated in the indictment; this is the note - it was in consequence of her producing this that I let her have the things; I did not know that there was such a person as Lady Auckland, but I believed there was, and I dealt with the prisoner as her agent - I did not give her credit; she gave an order for some other goods, to be sent for her ladyship to see the following morning; she said she had been in Lady Auckland's family ever since she was a child of six years old - we have ascertained there is no such person; the goods she had amounted to 14l. odd; I made the bill in the name of Lady Auckland - I gave credit till the following day, when these goods were to be paid for, with some others which were to be sent; the prisoner gave her name as Maria Perry, No. 12, Aldersgate-street - I had suspicion, and sent a person to watch her, and she went to the Grafton Arms, Grafton-street; I found her there the following morning; I met her coming down stairs, and I told her I had ascertained the note was a forgery, as I had been to Lord Auckland's; she said it could not be the case, and she would go with me to Lord Auckland's; I said, "You had better come with me to the Police-station" - I sent for an officer, who took her; she had had all these goods away, but I found them all at the Grafton Arms - I had been there the night before, and they said no such person had been there, but I got up early the next morning, and found her; she had cut up one or two of the articles.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Every thing he states is correct but the name - I said Mary Perry, No. 13, Aldersgate-street.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 15th of February I saw the prisoner drunk in Tottenham-court-road - I had not known him before; I advised him to go home, but he would not, and I took him to the watch-house; I found two stone bottles on him - he said one contained gin, and the other sherry; I asked where he got them - he said he bought them of Mr. Henekey, where he worked; I went down, and found he did not buy them there - the next morning Mr. Henekey charged him with stealing them, and he acknowledged, in my presence, that he took them - these are the bottles.</p>

            . I live at Ruislip. On the 20th of March, about eleven o'clock at night, I was returning from Mr. Meadows, at the sign of the Sun and Ship, and as I came out at the door the prisoner hustled me, but I did not miss the watch for about five minutes; I then returned, and accused him of taking it out of my fob; he denied it- I locked him in the bar while I sent for the officer, and kept him there about two hours; he then said he saw a man go across the road with something like a watch - I asked where he put it; he said if I went through the gate, and looked on the left-hand side, I should find it - the landlord went with a candle, and found it; this is it.</p>

            . I am a slater. I met the prisoner on the 18th, about eleven o'clock; he asked me if I knew any body who wanted to buy a truck - I said I did not; he said he had one to sell very cheap, and asked if I could recommend him to any one; I had known him for some time - he asked where I lived, and I gave him my card at No. 22, Milbank-street; he asked what time I should be at home - I said about six o'clock; he said he gave 50s. for the truck, that his wife had run away with some money, and he wanted 1l. to go after her - he came to me in the evening; I let him have 2s., and told him to go over the way and get some beer - he left the trunk with me that night, and the next morning I saw the prosecutor's name on it, and went to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he owed Banfield 2s., and he had taken the truck from the public-house door, in payment, without his consent.</p>

            . I was house-surgeon of Middlesex-hospital. On the 28th of February Harrington was brought there, about two o'clock in the morning - I found a would on the left side of the abdomen, about an inch long, and in about ten minutes after he was admitted a portion of the intestines came through the wound - they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050034"/>were replaced, and the wound dressed; he died in consequence of that wound twenty-three hours after his admission; his body was opened, and the intestines were found wounded in four places.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BABRY. Q. Did he appear to have been drinking? A. He appeared a little in liquor, but not drunk - I judge he had been drinking by the smell- he was almost insensible, which was the effect of the injury; I did not open his head - I am sure he did not die of apoplexy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I suppose the four parts of the intestines had been wounded at the same time? A. I should judge so; the wound had been inflicted by stabbing with some cutting instrument - the Policeman brought me a knife, which I fitted to the wound; it was the exact size of it.</p>

On the 20th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner purchased a few articles at our shop, and paid me a 5l. Bank note - I gave her the change, and gave the note to the cashier, without getting her address on it; he returned it to me - I took it back to her, and asked her address; I am sure it was the same note, for it was not out of my sight - she gave me her name, Mrs. Willson, No. 24, Portland-street, which I put on the note - (looking at a note, No. 17,880) I am sure this is the note I received from her; I afterwards applied at No. 24, Portland-street, and found no person named Wilson lived there; she wore a straw-bonnet, a black veil, and dark clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I suppose she was a stranger to you? A. Yes; I do not recollect what goods I served her with, not the exact amount -I believe I have said it was about three or four o'clock, but believe it was about four - I was not very busy that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What distance is your shop from Poplar? A. I should think five or six miles - it was on a Tuesday, the day before Fast day.</p>

               <p>PERUE (being a Mahometan was sworn on the Alcoran.) I was with the prosecutor when the prisoners were there; we stopped at a beer-shop in the Commercial-road; the prosecutor paid for what we drank, and went on first, leaving me and the prisoners behind - the prisoners followed him, leaving me behind to finish the beer, and on turning round, I saw Waters snatch the handkerchief, and ran away with it - I did not notice Williams do any thing.</p>

             (the interpreter). I saw Waters the morning after this took place - the prosecutor was talking to me, and Waters was coming down the barrack-yard, and seeing me talking to the prosecutor he came up to me, and begged pardon for robbing the prosecutor; he said he did not know there was any money in the handkerchief, but when he found money in it he spent it, but was very willing to make it up in any way he could.</p>
               <p>The evidence was communciated to the prisoners by the interpreter.</p>
               <p>Waters. I am a stranger in this country; this is the first offence - I have done wrong, but am willing to make it up in any way; I hope you will be as lenient as possible.</p>

I was with my sister - there was a crowd at the corner of Bouverie-street; I had great difficulty to get her through the crowd - she complained of her reticule being cut; I looked round, and a gentleman directed my attention to the two prisoners, who I saw running down Bouverie-street; I followed - they made two or three turns, but I kept them in sight; they were stopped near Temple gate; when I got near them I laid hold of Jones first - he ran to the wall; they were then examining the purse, which was in his hand; just as I laid hold of him he ran to the wall, and threw the purse over, at the back of some chambers - I went afterwards and took it up- I knew the keys in it belonged to my sister.</p>

            . I live in Vale-street, Camberwell. I was in St. Paul's church-yard, and saw the prosecutor and a gentleman walking before me, and the prisoners walking behind them; I was standing talking to a gentleman, and saw one of them stoop and take up the tail of the prosecutor's coat; he put his hand into the pocket, and I saw him draw something out, which I believe was a handkerchief - I ran and told the gentleman; he stopped one of them in Canon-alley - I saw them both in the watch-house in a few minutes, and am certain of them. I am a sugar-refiner.</p>
               <p>Birch. Q. Did you see me in company with the other prisoner? A. No.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could you see which took the handkerchief? A. No, but I am sure it was one of them - it was dark, but I was near the shops; people were passing.</p>

            . I am a hosier. I was in St. Paul's church-yard, with Mr. Trueman; Brunatti informed me Mr. Trueman's pocket was picked, and pointed up Canon-alley - I immediately looked, and there was nobody in the court but the prisoners - Mr. Trueman took Birch, and I secured Jones in a court between Paternoster-row and Newgate-street; I saw him drop the handkerchief - a boy standing by took it up and gave it to me; he said nothing; I said, "This is the boy who has got the handkerchief;" Trueman immediately let go of Birch, and seized Jones - Birch immediately ran off as hard as he could, but was secured; I have no doubt of him.

On the 19th of March, about half-past three o'clock, the prisoner came in to buy several articles, and asked for watch-keys, among others, but bought nothing; I put nine or ten keys on the counter, and turned from him to get some seals and a watch from the window for him - my back was to him; he was about three-quarters of an hour in the shop, and selected a few articles - he said he would pay me part of the money, and if I went with him to Holborn, he would pay me the rest - while he was saying this, I missed two keys from the counter, and told him so; he said I had better look on the work-board, to see if I had not put them there - I turned to it, but did not find them, and on turning suddenly round, I saw him shake one of them from his left hand sleeve; he had had several in his hand - his sleeve was very large, and one might probably get there by accident; I charged him with having another - he said he had not and that I had better look among the others on the board; I did so, but did not find it - in a few minutes he said, "Here it is," and gave it to me from the other end of the counter; I heard it fall on the counter, but do not know where from - I had laid the articles I showed him on a leather; I shook that leather, and possibly it might have got there - it is very probable; I said I would search him before he left, to see if he had my property - he said, "Oh no," then opened the door, and went away; I, not knowing whether my property was all safe or not, unfortunately pursued, and brought him back, but no property was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. What is the length of the counter? A. It is very short; he tried on a watch-guard - the key might have dropped into his sleeve, when he put up his hand to put the guard over his neck; I beg to say, before my servant gives evidence, that I cannot take her word at all times, and beg your Lordship and and the Jury not to consider what she says - I would not believe her, and intend to discharge her when her month is up; from what has occurred since, I should not like her evidence to be taken - she was behind the glass door of the parlour.</p>

I saw the prisoner come up the yard, and in about five minutes, saw him going down the yard, with the case on a porter's knot; it weighed 2 cwt. - I saw two men come up the yard with him; they went down the yard about a minute before him - I followed, and brought him back with it; I asked where he was going to take it - he said, to Chiswell - street, but did not tell me the number, or which end of the street; he then said he was employed by two persons who had gone down the street, and wished me to go after them, but I did not think proper - he said it was a pity he should get into trouble when he was innocent; I gave him in charge, and said I would go to anybody for him - I opened the case, and all the books were in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not see two gentlemen go in with me? A. Yes, they came out before you; he said those gentlemen had employed him - I did not see them when I stopped him, nor afterwards.</p>

            . I am a constable. Clark called me to take the prisoner; he said two persons employed him in Chiswell-street to come and fetch the case from Bond's- he did not say what part of Chiswell-street; he said he was well known at two houses, but when we went there they did not know much of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took me to a public-house where I had been acting as porter for three months, but I owed the landlord 8d., and he said he knew me, but not lately; I lost a situation through getting intoxicated, and now get my living by portering for different gentlemen.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know Redding before? A. Yes, for a good many years - I have purchased a deal of straw of him; I consider him honest; I have generally paid him, and he has paid the carters who have brought the straw or hay - I considered I was buying this of Redding, and I treated Henwood as his servant; I had no receipt; I knew that it could not be Redding's except by his buying it - I have not seen the carman paid before, but I believe the money has been paid regularly; I believe Redding gets his living by purchasing straw and hay; he has bought a good deal for me and other persons, who keep stables.</p>

I took all the prisoners; I took Fielder first, close to the station-house; the carman who was with me told him what he was taken for - he made no answer; I took Cannon and Henwood the same night, at the Blue Posts - I told them it was for selling some straw and keeping the money - Henwood, who was tipsy, said it was a druken frolic - Cannon was sober, and said nothing; I took Redding on the Saturday night afterwards; I told him I apprehended him for selling the straw and not paying the farmer; he made no reply- I had been looking for Redding all the week, and at last I watched his wife, and took him at a public-house up a mews in Regent-street.</p>

On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050042"/>the morning of the 23rd of March, between two and three o'clock, I was near the prosecutor's premises, in Kensington-gravel-pits; I heard a step, and then heard some person say, "Lay still" - I saw a cart near the wall; I went to it, and found in it two sacks of kitchen stuff, and saw some person laying down; I said,"What are you doing there?" - Clark got up and ran, and I after him, about one hundred yards, but I took him without losing sight of him; I went back, and saw Watts about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's, coming home- I took him, and asked who he had been with; he said,"With Clark and Avile" - I asked him to show me where Avile lived; he told me, and I went, but I could not find him - I examined a shed which had been broken open, and the padlock was broken all to pieces.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On Wednesday, the 21st of March, I had some metal spoons on a dresser in the back room - I afterwards saw a rummer-glass on the bar; the prisoner came that evening, and had some bread and cheese - he went into the bar, and I think into the tap-room; I then missed a glass, and went to the tap-room - I saw the prisoner there; I had a stick in my hand - I struck his pocket, and heard a glass break - he took it from his pocket himself: it was ours - I then told him to feel again, and he took out a wine-glass; I then told him to let me look into his pocket, and he took out two spoons, one of which is ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. What is there particular about these glasses? A. I know this one by the bottom of it - it was figured glass, but has been more broken since; there were several persons there - I do not know whether any were intoxicated; I do not think the prisoner was - I did not miss a pint pot; he denied having the glasses, and when he pulled them out, he said he did not know who had put them there - he offered me 1s. for them; he staid there, I suppose, two hours afterwards, and then went home - I knew where he had lived for some years; several persons in the tap-room said they thought he put them in himself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you first say to him? A. I said I thought he had some of my glasses - he said he had not: I said I should like to see - he then pulled out this glass; I asked if he had not another, and he pulled out this wine-glass - I said it was like mine - I then asked what he had in his other pocket, and he took out the spoons- they had been jovial together, but I did not see any tricks; I heard afterwards that Lawrence was accused - it did not appear that there had been any tricks played; he was not apprehended for a week afterwards - my husband was busy, and I could not go about it myself; he did not come to our house in the interim - he is a labourer; the things were taken from two different rooms.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not his pocket so constructed, that it might easily be got at? A. I cannot say - his coat was unbuttoned; he was not drunk - I had been there an hour or two; some of the men were rather merry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The constable came and took me - I waited two hours for the prosecutor; he said I must go with him; I said, "I don't like all this, I would rather settle it;" he said he should not have done it, but that I had said that his wife had put broken glasses into my pockets, that she might accuse me of taking whole ones.</p>
               <p>MR. MEADOWS. I did not say any such thing - he wanted to settle it, and I said it was impossible.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did they not belong to your father? Witness. No, four of them are mine, and one is my father's.</p>

            . I am a Policeman (I T.) On Friday, the 23rd of March, I went in search of the prisoner - I took him; he said he knew nothing about the robbery on the 22nd - the spoon he took on the 19th had been found; I took him from London to Hammersmith, and when we got there he said he had sold the spoons to Mr. Buchanan, a refiner, in Raquet-court, Fleet-street - I went there, and found these pieces of spoons, which Miss Denman can swear to.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I ran, like the rest, and being swift of foot, I got before them; a young man came to me in Gray's Inn-lane, and said he thought I was the person who had robbed the prosecutrix - when the prosecutrix came up, she would not lift up her head to look at me; I asked her two or three times, but she would not.</p>

Yes - I told the prisoner the bill was dishonored, and sent one Burly with it, and the prisoner to the house of a lady of rank in Brook-street; I and the officer waited at the corner of Brook-street till they returned; the prisoner came back to us - he knew the officer was with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you not in the early part of your lives, accommodated each other with loans? A. Frequently; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050050"/>said that to the extent of 10l. or 20l. he might use my name - I said so about four months ago.</p>


               <p>Q. Now, you seen very hard of hearing - perhaps he may have requested leave to write your name, and you might have made a mistake, and said Yes? A. Such a thing might happen - he bore a very good character.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner with the fender and baize; she said her son had bought the fender on purpose for her to look at, as she was going to be married, and she was taking it back to her son's, No. 2, Johnson's-court, Commercial-road - that she lived at No. 40, Church-street; I found a young woman there, who at first denied knowing her - I found a key on the mantelpiece, which opened the prosecutor's parlour door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My son brought the fender that morning for my daughter to look at, to see if she would purchase it; I should not have carried it with the green cloth on it if I had stolen it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I met the prisoner at the corner of Bartlett's-buildings, Holborn, and told him I had information that he had run away from the workhouse with some linen - he said, "I did, and I would sooner go to Botany-bay than the workhouse again."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The Policeman was about half drunk, and took me to three different public-house to drink - if I had made away with the things, I should have had money or duplicates - I met three men, and was drinking with them; and while I went backwards my bundle was taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you always pay on delivery? A. Yes, except once, about twelve months ago, when I was ill - I did not then request him to pay his master for me; I paid him at the next delivery.</p>

            . I live in Barnsbury-row, White Conduit-fields, and manage the business for my mother, who deals with Mr. Hubbard. On the 28th of February the prisoner brought goods, which came to 6s. 10d.; I paid him for them, and took this receipt - (read.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you often paid him money? A. Not very often; I received goods from him without paying.</p>
               <p>MR. HURBARD. The prisoner has never paid me these sums; I am the person he should account to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he boarded and lodged with you? A. Yes - I allowed him 5s. a week besides; he was to find his clothes and washing - I never charged him with being deficient in his accounts, and afterwards found I was mistaken; I once gave him time to pay a sovereign, which he said he had lost - he never paid me money in advance for customers; I did not promise to give him time to make up these sums - he was apprehended on the 2nd of March; I settled with him on the 1st of March - I call over from the book the names of persons he has been to, and he states what he has received; when he came home on the 14th of February he said Mrs. Jones could not pay.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Sowerby, pawnbroker, Brick-lane. On the 25th of February the prisoner came to our shop, and brought a shawl to pawn - I saw a ticket at the corner, and asked whose it was; she said her own - I saw W. C. on it, and said, "This is Mr. Combs', in Church-street, and here is a ticket for 5s. on it" - she said, "That is what I gave for it this morning;" I took her there, and when the officer took her she said she had picked it up outside the door.</p>

I felt the basket, and said, "You do not send baskets to the country without a direction, do you?" he said, "You may look at it if you like;" I said, "I must look at you as well"- I put him into the watch-house; I felt something warm in the basket, and found in it one duck, one cock, and eight hens - I then sent our serjeant after Higgins, and he had one duck in each pocket; I found the prosecutor the next morning.</p>

            , (Police-serjeant A 11.) On the 23rd of February I was at No. 5, Mill-hill-mews; I heard some one going before me, and when I got to the bottom of the stairs I saw the prisoner go out at the front door; he first walked, and then ran on to Chatham-place, where I took him - he had dropped a pair of shoes in Henrietta-street, which I took up, and pursued; he then threw something away, which rattled; I went on, and took him to the station - in going along a boy brought me one stirrup, which he said he picked up at the place where I heard the prisoner drop something; I then went back, and found this other iron.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I know where these tools were kept; I saw the prisoner in the yard, and apprehended him, as he came over the fence, about half-past five o'clock - he said he was going to work with the shovel; he ran from me - I took him again; he then said he stole the shovel, but was compelled to do it from want.</p>

               <p>JOHN FARDELL. I had been paid off from the Athol on the 27th of February, and came from Portsmouth to the Elephant and Castle - I went in there on the 28th, to find a man to take my luggage home, and one man said he would take it for 10s.; I said I would rather spend the money on the road - the prisoner said he would take me to <placeName id="t18320405-148-crimeloc893">Old Ford</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALMESLEY. Q. What time did you get to the Elephant and Castle? A. A little after seven o'clock in the morning - I had travelled all night; I had not drank any thing from Portsmouth to London; when we got to the Elephant and Castle we had a glass of brandy-and-water between two of us - the prisoner's was a small one-horse cart; in going along we had a glass of rum a piece; the prisoner did not go into the house; he stood on the footpath - I sat on the front of the cart, and on the collar of my coat; it was a pea-jacket; I am sure I saw it there when I got out at my mother's door - I saw it at the last minute; the prisoner drove off as soon as I had paid him, as fast as he could; he was flogging his horse - he had not got more than twenty or thirty yards when I called him; I have always told the same story - he was taken on the 15th of March; I had been at home in the interval, and had been two or three times to the Elephant and Castle to look for him, from eleven o'clock till five; I at last found him standing against the door there - I did not see his cart then; I had talked with him on the road to Old Ford - I did not notice whether he was deaf; I have seen his wife since he was taken; I told her if she would pay me for my jacket and for my trouble I would not see further into the business - that was before I went to the office.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutor at the Elephant and Castle - I went with him to Old Ford; I recollect his calling after the prisoner - he must have heard him, but he drove away as fast as he could; I am sure the coat was there when we got out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you on board the Athol? A. Yes; I had come from Portsmouth with the prosecutor - we had nothing on the road till we got to the Elephant and Castle; we had a glass of rum in the Whitechapel road - I am quite sure his coat was in the cart at the door; he missed it in two minutes, when we got into the house; the cart was not thirty yards off at the outside.</p>

I have a wife and child starving, and the parish won't relieve me;" I said, "Take them back to where you got them from, and I will say nothing about them;" they said,"No, we will not, we will stick to our cargo" - they were taken into custody the same night.</p>

On the 24th of February, the prisoner came to their warehouse; I served him in the morning with two pieces of thread web, and in the afternoon, with a gross of cannadine laces - I did not serve him with any thread or silk; in leaving the warehouse he had to ascend some stairs - I saw him stoop and open his bag: I then followed him up - I heard something fall; I still followed him, and when I saw him again, he was taking a parcel off a pile of thread on the stairs, and putting it into his bag; I asked him what he was going to do with it - he said he had picked it up on the stairs - I told him to come down, and called one of our young men; in the mean time he opened his bag, pulled out half a dozen of thread, and said he had picked it up - that was not the half-dozen which he had when I spoke to him; he must have had them before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you given the same account as you did before the Magistrate? A. Yes; he was out of my sight for some time in going up stairs - the threads lay in great piles on the stairs; they may fall if a person hits them - he has been in the habit of purchasing at our shop for years, I have understood - I had not served him with thread or silk that day.</p>

            . I had marked this parcel of thread, and had been serving some of this silk before he came - he was swinging his bag over his arm when he came in, and it appeared to be empty; this silk was found in his pocket at the watch-house - he said he had bought it of a Jew in Petticoat-lane, but he could not tell his name; this piece of web was found in his bag - I had not sold it to him; I know it by my mark on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written,) My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. - On the 24th of February, I went to the prosecutor's ware-house, and bought a few articles, which I took with me in my bag; as I was coming out of the warehouse, I took up the half-dozen of thread, which I am now charged with stealing, as is customary with every person that goes into a wholesale warehouse to buy goods, if they see an article they think will suit them; knowing the witness Matthews was behind me, I was in the act of turning round to ask him the price - to my great surprise, he then charged me with the intention of stealing it, which, I most solemnly declare, I had not the slightest intention of doing; the witness Matthews also swears I had the half-dozen threads in my bag, which is a direct falsehood, as the bag was never off my arm. and as he was walking behind me all the way, it was impossible I could have put it in without his knowledge.</p>

            . I live at No. 11, Duke-street, Spitalfields - I am a tailor. I have known the prisoner about six years; I have often been with him at sales; I remember something about his buying a crape dress; I think this is it - yes, I can swear it is - he brought it to my house about eight months back; I saw him did for this and for two white dresses in Petticoat-lane - all sorts of things come to Petticoat-lane; it was long before December; I think it was about August - I know this is the dress; I had it in my hand the same evening at my place, about two hours after he bought it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are you a judge of dyeing? A. No; I cannot tell whether this has been dyed once or twice; I have seen a great many shawls of this description; I noticed the pattern of that which was brought to my house- it was what I call a zig-zag; the border might be about twelve inches - I understood it was a shawl.</p>

            , who was then dead - I appeared before the Magistrate on the 18th, and at his request, opened the body - there was a very considerable external wound on the cheek-bone; the bone was laid bare - on opening the head the temporal muscle was in a high state of inflammation, and an effusion of blood had taken place; the vessels of the brain were turgid - there were two wounds on the lower jaw, one several inches long, and a contusion on the upper part of the head, on the temple - it was clear she had come to her death by violence, which could not have been committed by herself; I ascribe the turgid state of the vessels to concussion - the blows must have been violent to produce such injury; it must have been done by some instrument, it could not be done by the fist - she had been dead some time when I first saw her; decomposition had taken place to a certain degree - she was a very old woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you think that forcing open a door to go into a room, could have produced these wounds? A. Certainly not all the wounds, nor could a fall do it - it must have been violence offered by somebody.</p>

I examined the body on the day of the Inquest; the head had already been examined, and I could only from an opinion from external appearances; I found a large coat used wound on the outer angle of the right temple - it was severe and dangerous, also two lacerated wounds on the chin, with some appearance of a bruise on the left side - the wound on the chin seemed very probably the cause of death; it might be inflicted by any hard substance - if by a door pushed suddenly on her it must have been with great violence; a clenched fist would have done it, I think - the other wounds appeared not dangerous, and to have been made after death; only one wound appeared to have been made during life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written,) The prisoner most solemnly declares his innocence of the charge; his poor deceased mother was seventy-eight years of age - she had been very unwell for for several months: about nine o'clock on the evening of the 3rd of February, the prisoner returned home and knocked at his door two or three times before he could gain admittance - vexed with his wife for keeping him so long, and not suspecting but that it was his wife who was then letting him in, he flung the door back rather hastily and angrily - the edge of the door struck his poor mother on the cheek bone, who had come from her own bed, to which she was almost wholly confined, but was never aware that she had received this blow until after her death- somewhat in liqour, angry at having been kept waiting, (but extremely so on finding that his mother was obliged to leave her bed to open the door for him), on getting to his own room, he had words with his wife, and struck her, which induced her to call out murder; the cries were from his wife, and not from his mother - they proceeded from up stairs, and his mother slept below, on the ground floor, and it is presumed that it could hardly he possible for any of the witnesses to mistake the voice of a woman of fifty years of age for a poor old woman of seventy-eight, who had been for a long time ill, and whose voice was scarcely articulate; it has been asserted, although not attempted to be proved, that the prisoner had spent 5l. of his mother's money, and that he would derive an interest from her death - this is wholly unfounded; she had a small annuity of twelve guineas per annum, payable monthly, left her by the late Dr. Brown, of Islington, with whom she had lived as a servant, and which annuity died with her.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had he ever done work for you before November, 1830? A. Never - I considered he was the man who had first made it, which induced me to go there to have it repaired; I now know he did not make it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Although the Magistrate adjourned the case for the prisoner to produce the machine, when he came up without it he was discharged? A. The Magistrate let it stand over to give him an opportunity to produce it; this was on Saturday night- it was adjourned till Monday; I attended then, but the prisoner never came - I did not know him before; his father had made the machine; I did not call at the prisoner's house, and ask if the machine was to be sent for, nor did I send any body about it, nor did he call on me - I never called and said he was to send for it, nor say I had not made up my mind whether I would have that repaired or have a new one.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the proceedings before a Magistrate was an action brought against you? A. I suppose three or four months; I was served with a copy of a writ, in November or December - I believe he has given notice of trial; I have pleaded to the action - I did not know where Carney was to be found at the time I went before the Magistrate - my wife is not here, nor my son, he is only a child; I had left my business in care of my wife when I was out; she keeps my books, and attends to what is going on - when I went to the prisoner's house, in February, he was gone; I saw no board nor bill on the house, nor any reference to Mr. Price's over the way- nobody could tell me where he was gone; he had taken all his things; I inquired at almost every machine-makers in the neighbourhood; when I found he had come to live in Long-lane I called at his house, but could not find him; I left an address for him to call at Wincott's, in Princes-street, Cavendish-square, on business - they sent for me when he came, and I had him, taken; I knew Wincott had ordered a machine of him, and he had brought it there that day; I took the Policeman, and he took him into custody - I knew nothing of a Policeman being there before, and refusing to take him - Wincott did not, in my presence, attempt to give him in charge for not leaving the premises with the new machine - the Magistrates did not desire it to be given up.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Chambers, the apprentice, is here; did you say on that occasion "You knew me Mr. Heard?" A. No, nor did he say, "Yes, Mr. Scott, I do - I have an old weighing machine of yours," nor that he hoped I was not offended at his not having repaired it; I did not say, "Now, old boy you are regularly done," nor any such words - I had him taken up as soon as I came into the house; (looking at a paper) this was not written by me - I believe it is Wincott's writing: I do not recollect whether he gave it to the prisoner in my presence - I did not see him write it; I was busy - I did not see it put into the prisoner's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the contents? A. I cannot say I know every word; it is within the last fortnight that I first spoke to Carney - I have given him no money, nor promised him any; I have not given him drink, nor kept him from work, nor made him any promise - I swear positively that the machine found is the one that was on my premises; I have my own mark on it, and could swear to it among one hundred and fifty - I have mended it and re-mended it.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe your son is about thirteen years old? A. Yes, he was about eleven years old when this happened.</p>

I never saw her any more - we took it home to the shop, and after a few days there was another machine we had sold which had come to be repaired, and the man came kicking up a row about it; it was Harper who lived in Fox-court, Charterhouse-lane; "Well" (said the prisoner) "we will put Scott's machine in the place of this; we will fit it up, so that it will appear like Harper's, and we will take it to Long-lane;" I knew he had sold Harper's machine, and saw him receive the money, and took it down to Brook-street; I afterwards went with him to Harper's and delivered the machine - Harper said, "This board to the machine is not mine;" Heard said, "Why, yes, in repairing the machine the bolt split, but you have got a better one" - it was better than Harper's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember afterwards seeing Mr. Scott's machine at Wheeler's in Oxford-street? A. Yes - I knew it at once; I have known it ten years - I had made some alterations in it, and knew my own work; the prisoner sent to me after that, about the 4th of April, 1832, and said, "Now we have got a machine, that will pass off for Scott's, and won't you swear to it?" I said, "If I am put on my oath I will tell the truth; anything you like to take down in writing you may, but I won't swear to it if I am brought to the oath; as soon as I am put to my oath I will never swear to it;" because I knew where the machine was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what you were to do to the machine when it was to pass for Scott's? A. Yes, he said, "We can put some iron hoops on the board to make it pass;" I said, "That is playing away with it, and when we are put to our oaths it won't do;" he said, "Well, don't you go at all, I will get another man to swear to it" - the prisoner lived in Charles-street, Bridgewater-gardens at the time we brought the machine from Scott's; he lived in Barbican when Scott called about it - he did not tell Mrs. Scott he had changed his residence; it was not a quarter of a mile off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had a Mr. Price lived in the house the father occupied? A. He lives there now - he is a milkman; there was not a bill up at master's house till we removed to Long-lane; there was then one with a reference to Price; he had his name up in Long-lane, but not in Charles-street; he was there three-quarters of a year before there was a name put up; he carried on business there, and I worked for him - it was there I changed Scott's machine; Chambers, the apprentice, did not go with us to Scott's - I will swear that nobody went but master and me; he has given his name as having been, but on my oath he never went - I saw no boy at Scott's and heard nobody say, "Mother, it is all right, Mr. Heard is to have the machine home to repair," but Heard told me the boy said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did he say so? A. The day he was at Guildhall, some time before Christmas - he said,"If you are put to it, and questioned about this, you always say you heard Mr. Scott's son say that the machine was to go;" I said, "Will there be an oath required?" he said, "No, there won't;" I said, "Well then, it is all right, but never bring me where I am sworn;" he said, "Any thing I tell you you may say, there will be no oath required" - I said, "Well, that is all right."</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Have you ever been in trouble yourself? A. Never; I was never before a Magistrate in Ireland - a young woman robbed me of 15s. last Session, and no bill was found against her; I never knew Mr. Scott had a son - master said there was an action against Mr. Scott, and he took me before somebody; (looking at a paper) a paper was read to me - I do not know what is here; I was not sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the Jury to understand that all this time you were lending yourself to all these falsehoods? A. Falsehoods! No; what I have stated here about the machine is real truth - I did not go before a Magistrate; I went before the Grand Jury on Monday week - I have seen Chambers, the apprentice, since that; I have been at his master's ten times since - I did not say I should not come to work again for any b - y master; nor that Scott had given me money, and would give me 5l. more, or that I had been with Scott all the week, and had formed a plan against master; it is all false - I do not know Aggus a street-keeper of Aldersgate; I have told nobody that Scott had given me money, and would give me as much more as I wanted.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time of day did you go to Scott's for the machine? A. The lamps were lighted, and when we got there, I think it was between five and six o'clock; (looking at a machine) this is the very machine- it is Mr. Scott's; this part ought to be five inches higher - we cut it off to bring it down to the same height as the one we had sold, and here is a piece of wood which we coloured the same as a cast-iron pillar, which is here.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. How many machines have you made? A. A good many; I cannot tell how many - I do not swear to this by the pattern; we did not make this one, but repaired it - we took Scott's machine to Harper one Saturday night; it was in March, last year.</p>

            . I live in Orchard-street, Westminster. I have a brother, living in Church-lane; the prisoner had a machine of mine, but my nephew contracted with him to repair it in my absence - the prisoner brought a machine home in Charterhouse-lane; it was about thirtesen months ago - I said, "Mr. Heard, these are not the boards that were on my machine;" he said he had a machine at home, and in taking my machine to pieces, he split the boards, and put these on instead; Carney was present- I suppose he had had my machine in his possession about six weeks; I had been to his house to demand it once, twice, or thrice, but could not get it - I could never see him, till he brought the machine to me; I took the machine he brought me home, and afterwards disposed of it to Mr. Wheeler, of Oxford-street - this is the very machine (looking at it.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is it not the machine you originally had? A. It is not; I have never found my own machine - this is Mr. Scott's; not one particle of it is mine - but the boards were what I first found out to be wrong.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any name on the machine which he had of yours? A. I believe the name of Nichols was on it.</p>
               <p>MR. SCOTT. The prisoner's father made my machine, and his name is now on it.</p>
               <p>(Prisoner's Defence (written.) I am a weighing-machine maker, now carrying on business in Long-lane, Smithfield; have lived all my life in the neighbourhood - I was applied to by Mr. Scott, the prosecutor, in February, 1830, while I resided in Barbican, to go to his house to look at the machine, which wanted repairing; I agreed with him about it, and was to send for it, and repair it when it suited me; I went with my apprentice, John Chambers, and my journeyman, George Carney, on the 19th of February, with a truck for the machine; Mr. Scott was not at home, and Mrs. Scott said she knew nothing about it, but her son said he did, and it was right that I should have it, as he heard his father agree with me about it; he then, with a light, accompanied me, my man, and apprentice, into the cellar - helped us with it, and helped us also to start the truck - shortly afterwards, I removed to Charles-street, Bridgewater-square, being prosecuted for not having my freedom of the City, and I put a bill up at Barbican, referring persons to a neighbour for my residence; it being down two or three streets - I remained these carrying on my business without any public show, until the half quarter between Michaelmas and Christmas, when I obtained a shop which I had long; been trying for on the privileged side of Long-lane; I then put up a board at my late residence, in Barbican, referring person to Long-lane - I kept the machine in a stable, with other lumbering, things, which I rented close by of a Mr. Field, and no application was made for it until after I had been taken before a Magistrate, at Malborought-street, for stealing it, who discharged me, and for which I brought an action, which is still pending - the action was commenced in December last, and I have been working in my shop, which is an open one, next the street, until I was taken into custody on the present indictment, which was only on Thursday last; I have not sent the machine home since the action for false imprisonment was commenced, under the advice of my solicitor.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's apprentice, and was no in February, 1831. I went with master and Carney to Mr. Scott's house; it might be the latter end of February; on the begining of March - we went to No. 1, King-street, Portman-square; we saw Mrs. Scott, a young man, and a lad - I suppose the young man was a journeyman; master told Mrs. Scott he had come for the weighing machine to repair; she said she knew nothing about it, as Mr. Scott was out - the young lad said, "It is all right mother," for that he had heard master and his father agree about it;" they showed us a light down into the cellar, and helped us up with it - the lad showed the light, and the man helped us up with it; the young lad started the truck off for us - we brought the machine home, and pulled it to pieces; it could not be repaired on the prosecutor's premises - a forge fire would be required to mend it; I have been four years in the business - the iron work must all go through the fire before it could be repaired; it was put into the stable, some part, and some pieces were left about.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was it not repaired immediately? A. Master said Mr. Scott was not particular and there was something about a new one, and he did not know what to do with it; it was put in the loft over the stable - my master lived in Charles-street then; he had left Barbican about three weeks; the night before he left I put up a bill referring persons to Mr. Price opposite, and cards were left there with the address - master left Barbican because the City prosecuted him for not being free; he remained in Charles street six or seven months, and carried on business there - it is about fifty yards from Barbican; he then moved to Long-lane, and attended to business regularly - in November last I remember a person coming to master's house for a machine; I saw Wincott, and I saw Mr. Scott; I know him now by sight - he called on the 4th of November, and asked if master was at home; I said No - he said"Give me a piece of chalk, I will write down my direction, for I want a new machine;" he wrote down,"Wincott, 7, Princes-street, Cavendish-square," and said;"Tell him to come there" - master made a new machine I and master went with it, on the 18th of November, to No. 7, Princes-street, Cavendish-square, to Wincott's; Wincott sent a little girl out of the parlour, to tell us to take it down into the cellar - master said, "I should like to see Mr. Wincott before I go into the cellar;" Wincott put his head out of the parlour, and Mr. Scott was with him-Scott said, "You know me, Mr. Heard;" "Yes, (said he) I have got an old weighing-machine of yours - I hope you are not offended at my keeping it so long;" Scott said, "Now old boy, you are regularly done" - master said, "Am I, how?" he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bill, gave it to Mr. Wincott, and said, "You are the man who ordered the machine, and I look to you for the money;" Wincott then said he would see master - (using some very bad expressions); master said he would take away the machine, if Wincott could not pay for it - Scott said, "Send your man for a Policeman, Wincott," and they used most dreadful expressions, and said they would lock him up; while Wincott's man was gone for the Policeman, Scott said; "I will go and fetch a Policeman myself," and used most dreadful expressions - while he was gone Wincott's man came with one; master was locked up in the shop - the Policeman was obliged to come in at the private door; Wincott told him to take charge of that man - the Policeman asked what for; Wincott said, "For committing felony;" master told him what it was about;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050070"/>the Policeman said, "I will take the weighing-machine and Mr. Heard to the station, if you please;" Wincott would not allow that; while they were in conversation Mr. Scott came in with a Policeman, and took master in charge; the Policeman said, "Our inspector has sent for you, and you must go" and took master to the station-house I suppose; the machine was standing in the shop - master has never got it back; I went before the Magistrate, and after that went with master to Wincott's house, to fetch the machine or money; I saw Wincott, Scott, and many more - Wincott said, if he dare to put his foot over the threshold of the door, he would knock his *** out; master told me to fetch a Policeman - I got one; master told him he had his property - the Policeman said he could not interfere, and then master came away; master never concealed himself, nor kept out of the way - I worked for him constantly: he brought an action against Scott; Carney went before a attorney with me, to give an account of the transaction; he went into the room as I came out - I gave the same account there as I have now; (looking at a paper) I saw this at Wincott's house, after we came back from the Magistrate's; Wincott wrote it, in the presence of Scott and two or three more; Wincott offered it to master, to sign; master said he would take it and consider of it - Scott looked over Wincott while he was writing it, and when he had written it, he said that would do; I know it to be the same paper - I met Carney in Cow-cross last Friday, just;" as he came out of his lodging; he said, "Halloo, Jack;" I then stopped, and he said, "I will not come to work for my (using the most dreadful expressions) master any more"- I said, "Why not, there is work waiting for you;" (he had left seven or eight days) - he said he had got money at Mr. Scott's, and did not want to come to work; that he had 5s. on Monday, and had been getting drunk almost every day; he was half drunk that morning; he said, "If I tell you any thing, don't you tell master;" I said I would not  - he said that he and Mr. Scott had formed a plan to go where one of master's machines were, where he had sold or repaired one, and to swear that was Mr. Scott's machine, and Mr. Scott would give him money for it; he doubled his fist, and said, "Don't you tell master" - master never told me to tell a falsehood about a machine; some part of Scott's machine is at home now, and some part is over the way; it has never been out of master's possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then that is not Scott's machine which has been produced? A. No; there is no name on the one we have at home - I do not know what name is on the one in Court.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did I understand you to say your master was busy, and it was thrown on one side? A. Yes, as he did not know whether Scott would have a new one; I am certain the part of the machine at home, and what is over the way, are parts of that we brought from Scott's.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you take sufficient notice of the machine you took away from Scott's, as to know it again? A. Yes, I helped to pull it to pieces - I noticed all the boards of it; there was no name on it, either printed or engraved; I am quite certain the machine brought from Scott's had no name on it - the name of Heard was not on it unless it was put on in writing, and got rubbed off - it was never cast on; there was no name at all on it: I recollect a machine going to Harperls; I cannot say whether there was a name on that - I will swear Harper's own machine was sent back to him; it went through the forge fire, and the pins were put to rights - the steels all thoroughly repaired, and it was put together again; another set of top boards were put to it - I do not know why, but I saw master put another board to it; some part of the old board was burnt - they were so shockingly split they were not worth putting on again; Harper had sent for his machine two or three times - he was not obliged to threaten about it; he was very good friends with master.</p>

               <p>Q. Could the name of your master's father be printed or engraved on Harper's machine, without your noticing it? A. I cannot take on myself to swear whether it was or not; master told me Mr. Scott had authorized him to take the machine home to his house - I did not see Scott when he called about it; I saw no chisel marks on Harper's machine - Mrs. Scott did not desire the machine should not be taken off the premises; I think I should know the man I saw there - he was present when Mrs. Scott spoke, and heard the little boy tell his mother it was all right, I am sure of that; the boy was fifteen or sixteen years old, I cannot say exactly - he might be more; he was somewhere about my size - he might be shorter; I am eighteen years old; (looking at

            ) I do not think that is the man who was there; I will not swear he is not- he has not the same dress - the man had a baker's dress on; there was only one man present - Carney worked for master a good deal, and was very much in his confidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as something very odd that for eleven months Mr. Scott never came to get his machine, nor a new one? A. I heard master say he had called on Mr. Scott, to know what was to be done, but I was at work, and did not take notice of it - I sometimes hear master say, "I am going so and so," or that he has been so and so; Carney has not worked for master since this day week - he has been in and out of the shop - master wanted him to come to work, but he would not; he said in the shop that he could get 5l.; that was in the patrol's presence - he was rather drunk at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not Carney say he would tell a false oath for no one, but if put to his oath he would speak the truth? A. No, he never said such a thing; he said he had prosecuted some girl, and he would go and swear any thing, right or wrong - it was on a Saturday, in 1831, that I went to Scott's for the machine; I am sure it was 1831, and the latter end of February, or the beginning of March- master generally goes himself, and it wants two persons to pull the truck.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the little boy shorter or taller than you? A. Rather shorter, and of a ruddy complexion; I think he wore a pinafore - I do not know his age.</p>

            . I am an extra patrol in the ward of Aldersgate. I was going down Long-lane, and was called by the last witness, who said his master wanted to see me- I went, and found the prisoner and Carney in an altercation about some law-suit; the prisoner said to me, "I wish you would listen to what this boy says;" he asked him to come to work for him - Carney said No, he would not work any more; he did not want work - the prisoner said he had had 5s. given him by Mr. Harper; Carney answered, "I have had 5s., and can have 5l. if I want it;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050071"/>he had been drinking, but was capable of knowing what he was saying - Heard's is a workshop quite open to the street; persons passing could see him in the shop; I have seen him there every night almost, for the last seven months.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Give us Carney's words? A. He said he would see him d - d first, he said he did not want work, for he had got money enough - the prisoner said,"He told me just now the party gave him 5s. last Monday;" he answered, "Yes, and I can have 5l.;" Mr. Scott's name was mentioned afterwards, but not at the time the money was spoken of; but the prisoner told me that there was an action pending, and Mr. Scott had gained this party over, and would not let him come to work - he said this in Carney's presence, after he mentioned the money; I did not take notice what reply Carney made - he might say, if he was put to his oath he would tell the truth, without my hearing it - he made no reply when it was said Scott had gained him over; when the prisoner told me the transaction, I turned round to Carney, and said, "If you have been examined by an attorney or Magistrate, what you have said is down in writing, and they will find you for perjury if you are in Ireland;" he swore, and said not one thousand people would find him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know he had been with an attorney, and his words taken down? A. The prisoner told me so, in his presence - it was my duty to go there when called by an inhabitant, I never spoke to Mr. Heard before in my life - I do not belong to that parish; I have not seen him since - he was taken into custody not five minutes after; Carney was the worse for drink - he was not drunk.</p>

            . I am a solicitor at the Lord Mayor's court-office. On the 3rd of September last, in consequence of instructions from the prisoner, I brought an action for false imprisonment, against Scott and Wincott - I have the proceedings as far as they have gone; there was a plea to the action, that the machine had been obtained by false pretences - I advised the prisoner as to whether he should keep the machine or send it home; I saw Carney about the latter end of November, that I should know what he could prove - his master was not present; he gave me an account of what he could swear - I have the paper which I took work for word from his mouth; I read it over to him - he said, "That is the truth, and that I will swear to;" I had told him to mind, and state nothing but the truth.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you the attorney in the action on the record? A. I am an attorney, but not being at present admitted in the Common Pleas, it was drawn by Mr. Sangster, but I am the prisoner's attorney in the action.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a plea that the machine was taken feloniously? A. There is.</p>

            . I am a potatoe-dealer, and live in Barbican. When the prisoner removed, notice was put up at his house, and references made to my house; I knew he had moved to No. 9, Charles-street, Bridgewater-garden, and he afterwards went to Long-lane; he attended to his business all the time, and kept an open shop.</p>
               <p> - HOW. I live in Charles-street, Bridgwater-square. The prisoner took my premises in Charles-street; there was no difficulty in finding him - so many people came after him, we wished him to move, the trouble was so great in answering them.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Scott's house on a Saturday night in February, when Heard came for the machine; I was in the parlour with Mrs. Scott - Scott's son must be eleven or twelve years old then; he is now between twelve and thirteen, but I do not recollect seeing the child there at all - I did not see Chambers there at all; he never came into the shop, and never made his appearance; Mrs. Scott never saw him, I am confident -I positively swear he was never within the door of the shop; Mrs. Scott said she knew nothing about it being arranged for the machine to be taken away, and she should not permit it to go from the premises in the absence of her husband - Heard then left the shop, and shut the door after him; I remained with Mrs. Scott till nearly eleven o'clock that night (they came about the machine about six); nobody could have spoken to Mrs. Scott about the machine without my hearing them, and nobody did speak to her about it - I had been there at least an hour before Heard came.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a word of truth in the declaration that when Mrs. Scott was applied to, a child said, "I was present when my father and Heard arranged it, and he agreed to let it go?" A. There is not.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Where was the boy? A. I did not see him - Mrs. Scott was in the parlour with me after Heard closed the door; we were making out the weekly bills - I suppose the workmen were gone, but do not know; there are generally three young men, and sometimes four - I am merely employed there on Saturday, to make out the bills; I am a clerk at the Court-house, Marylebone, on parish the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not four or five men below, where the machine was? A. I believe not; it is their habit to go as soon as business is over on Saturday; I did not see the machine go; the shop-door was shut - I advised Mrs. Scott not to let it go, for Mr. Scott had heard something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050072"/>derogatory about the prisoner, and that was the reason for not letting it go - we did not know it was gone till Mr. Scott returned, which was within half an hour; he went into the bakehouse, and missed it, and found fault that it had been allowed to go - the bakehouse door is not usually locked; the area gate is locked when all the men go, but it appears one man had not left.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you quite sure you recollect it so well that you advised Mrs. Scott to let it go? A. I did, and she positively refused to let it go.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. What did Mr. Scott say? A. He said, "You should not have allowed the man on any account to take the machine away, and why did you suffer it?" we said, "We did not suffer it; we insisted on his going away, or waiting till you returned, and did not know it was gone."</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was it not in consequence of some conversation between Donovan and the prisoner that you were induced to call upon him to make these purchases? A.

I had a fustain jacket on, and huff trousers, and a silk hat nearly new; the first time I saw his wife, which was when I went to his room, to ask for him I told her I knew a person named Neale, who was gone to Birmingham, and he told me to go and ask for some things - I did not ask about any dinner, nor pass myself off as a person in the same condition of life; I merely asked her to let me have some things - I had been at Birmingham, but I did not tell them so; I did not say I had a brother who drove a waggon to Covent-garden-market, and that he could pass the bad money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mena solemnly to declare that you never held out any inducement to his wife to go to Birmingham, or say what he has stated? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You found a person on the stairs? A. Yes, the person whom I had seen in the room the first time I was there; he knew I was going in, and he went up and gave three knocks with his hand - I had given him no sign, and was not in company with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was he a stranger? A. Yes; this is the half-sovereign he gave me - I did not find it was bad till the Saturday after; I had put it into my pocket-book in the drawer - I had five sovereigns there, but no half-sovereign; I did not expect to get the nine shillings back - I gave him them as the change of the half-sovereign, and the shilling was retained in part payment of rent - I gave him the change on the faith of the half-sovereign being a good one.</p>

            . Q. What did the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050076"/>say to you? A. He said, "It is usual to leave a deposit"- I said, "I don't require one;" he said twice "I would rather leave you a deposit;" I then looked what silver I had, and gave him 9s. - he had before asked what it was usual to leave; I said some left half a crown, but he might leave what he pleased - he said he was going to the timber yard, should want some silver, and he would leave 1s. if I could give him change for a half-sovereign; I had asked him what family there was, and he said his wife and himself; I could find no such place as that to which he referred.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to look for the place? A. No, my husband did - I have made inquiries, and there is no such place; I do not know how many Cleveland-streets there are in London; when I handed him the 9s. I expected a half-sovereign, and I had seen it in his hand-I parted with the 9s. upon the faith that I should get a half-sovereign.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You would not have given him change if he had not spoken of taking your lodging? A. No, certainly not; he took the lodging, and expressed a desire to leave a deposit, and I believed this to be really a half-sovereign at the time - I dealt with him on the footing of supposing he was about to become a lodger of mine; I did not hear of him till he was in custody.</p>

Yes, I have been instructed in it since the prisoners were committed; if what I have said be false, I shall go to hell; the parson told me to say so - I have been to church, but have not been taught the catechism; I never was in gaol before this time - I worked for Mr. Wade two years; he never charged me with taking a sovereign; I left him to go home to my father - I swear I never robbed him; I have never told any one that I used to rob Mr. Wade weekly, to supply my father with tobacco - since I have been in prison Saint has charged me with stealing a knife from him, but I did not; I stated before the Magistrate the same that I have now - I did not say that I saw Goodfellow go into the house while another boy held the door open, and when Goodfellow brought out the till, we divided the money; I said, they told me so; I did not say I was present, and they told me they divided the money as fairly as they could, by handfulls - I did not tell Mr. Johnson they were going to rob him, for fear they should give me a good hiding; I did not say any thing about it till I was in custody; I then told directly - I had no part of the money, and did not know where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you not tell an officer that you had buried 12s. of this money in a garden? A. I did not; I said Bentote went into our garden, and I told the officer I thought he had buried some money there - I happened to tell the exact place where the money was; I do not know how much was found, nor whether it was copper or silver.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the evening of Sunday, the 26th of February, I was on duty in Brick-lane, at a quarter-past six o'clock - my attention was attracted by three boys standing by a window -I can swear one of them was Saint; he had some copper money in his hand, and was trying to reckon it by the light of the window; I went up, and questioned him how he came by it; the other two ran away - Saint turned round, threw the money into my hands, and ran away; I overtook him, and asked how he got it; he said he got it from boys who he believed had thieved it - I asked if he knew the boys; he said Yes - I took him to the station-house; as we were going there, he told me the boys had more money, and some silver also; he told me the names of Prince, Goodfellow, and Bentote - when they were taken to the station, he charged them as being the boys; I found in Saint's pocket 1ls. 6d., in silver; there was one half-crown, with shillings, and sixpences; the other two prisoners were brought in about eleven o'clock, but nothing was found on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then Saint gave you the name of Prince? A. Yes, he said he was one of the boys who gave him the money - I was present when the till was found.</p>

            . I am pot-boy to Mr. Johnson. On Sunday, the 3rd of March, as I was getting in my pots, I saw Bentote at the back of my master's house; I asked how he thought he should get on - he said he did not know yet; I asked him if he had any of the money; he said he had but 1s. 6d. in silver, and some copper - he said the money was shared by handsfull; he said that Saint held the door, and Goodfellow went in and took the till, and they ran down in the hollow, emptied it into Goodfellow's cap, and he put it under his arm - they ran off where they thought no one could see them - I told him I thought they would get a severe flogging; he said he did not think that - he thought the case was not large enough, unless it went to Newgate, and he did not care about two or three month's imprisonment, so long as he did not get a teazing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You seem to have a very perfect recollection of it, how often have you told this? A. Two or three times; I do not recollect any thing being said about Prince peeping through the window, or his name being mentioned.</p>

            . (Police-constable F 21.) On the evening of the 6th of March I saw all the prisoners in Drury-lane; Jones had this knife-case under his arm, and a green apron covered over it; he went into a pawnbroker's shop, at the corner of Blackmore-street, and told the other two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050080"/>to wait outside - they were talking together, and then Jones went in; the other two waited outside - I went into the shop; Jones had put it on the counter, and offered it to pawn; I asked him who brought it - he said he had, to pawn it for his master, who lived at No. 14, New Church-court, Strand; I asked if he had any odjection to come with me to his master - he said, "Oh, no, not the least;" when we came out, he said it was all nonsense, it was not his master's, but that he and his companions had bought it of a young man named Robert Jones, who lived in Golding-buildings, and was a cabinet-maker - the other two prisoners were close behind at the time; I took them all to the watch-house - they then said the same as Jones, that they purchased it the night before for 2s.; Mr. Thomas asked them if that was the truth, and they both said Yes.</p>
               <p>Jones. Q. I did not say it was my master's, I said it was my own. Witness. He said it was his master's, and the pawnbroker said, "I think you will find it correct, officer, for he has often been here to pawn for his master."</p>
               <p>Jones. Q. I said the young man lived in Baldwin's-gardens, not Golding-buildings, but we bought it of him in Lincoln's Inn-fields. Witness. He said Golding-buildings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. Did you hear Jones tell them to wait outside the shop? A. I did not; they were talking together - he told them to wait, and he would see how much he could get for it; when I asked them if what Jones stated was the truth, they both agreed to it - I asked the question before Mr. Thomas came into the room, and when he came, I told him the charge; he asked them if it was bought of

            , and they both said it was true - I had asked them to discover who the property belonged to, and Jones told me that he and his companions had purchased it for 2s. the night before; when I saw them it was between five and six o'clock - it was not exactly dark; when I had brought Jones out, the other two walked behind us - I had my Police dress on; they must have known I was an officer, but I had directed two other officers to watch them - they were about two yards behind us.</p>
               <p>MR. EVANS. This is my knife-case; I missed it about five o'clock in the evening - my premises are about ten minutes' walk from Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When had you last seen it? A. Perhaps about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Jones. There was a man followed us down Drury-lane, from Holborn, and he fetched the officer from the Strand, and that man said at the station-house, that he walked by our side; he came into the pawnbroker's and told the officer, "That is the boy, and those are the other two."</p>

             Robson, a carpenter - we live at No. 370, in the Strand. I know the prisoner; he came to my house in March, and brought a small parcel, tied in paper, and told me to take particular care of it, till he either came or sent for it - he did not say what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect, you have been examined before - do you mean to say he did not tell you what the parcel was? A. No, Sir; he did not tell me it was tickets - I kept the parcel by me until two young ladies were sent for it; it might he about the size of the parcel produced (the duplicates) - I never opened it; when the Police-officer came I did not like to deliver them up, without Mr. Robson's leave, and I put them in the coal-cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put them when the prisoner gave them to you? A. In the coal-cellar; I had workmen in the house, and did not wish them to know where they where - I took the Police-officer into the cellar, and he found the parcel I had received; I saw they were duplicates when he opened it - about a fortnight after I received them from the prisoner, Maria Rossan brought me a note, in the prisoner's hand-writing; this might be about a fortnight before the officer came - I had them three weeks or a month; I do not know what I have done with the note - I have destroyed it; the note directed me to deliver the parcel to Rossan, which I did, and three or four days after I received it again; I believe it was the same - it was delivered to me at the door, in a bit of brown paper - there was a cloth about it at first, but I did not take particular notice of it then; the Police-officer came three days after that, I believe - I did not tell him they were tickets; he came and asked me for the tickets - I said I would not deliver them up to him, as I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050082"/>know him, but I would go the station, and give them up to Mr. Thomas, the superintendant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it to the station? A. No - I delivered it to the Policeman from the cellar; I did not put it into the cellar till after I received it back from Rossan - I cannot say it was the same as I had from the prisoner; it might he in the cellar about a week - nobody had any access to the cellar; it was the only place I had where nobody came -I put it into a box when I first received it, and then into the cellar, as there was no lock on the box - there was a lock to the cellar.</p>

            . I am book-keeper to an ironfounder, and live in Robinson's-row. I have known the prisoner several years - on the morning he was apprehended I went to Bow-street, and saw him; I saw him a day or two after, at the New prison, Clerkenwell - I said I was sorry for his situation, and asked him the charge; he said it was a charge of robbing or plundering a house in Highbury-place - I did not hold out any promise or threat to him; I asked him what had become of the property - he said he believed it was pledged; I then asked if he could get the duplicates - he said he thought they could be got, or that he could get them; I told him he had better let me have them - he said, "Very well;" I was at the office at his next examination - I saw Rossan about a week after, and I had seen her before at the house she resided at, in Upper Stamford-street, Blackfriars - the prisoner requested me to call on her to send him a shawl and a night-cap; I told her poor George was in gaol, and she was astonished - he told me to tell her so; when she was at the office, she delivered me a square parcel, about that size - I think it had a piece of silk over it; it was wrapped in something - I opened it after I left the office, and it contained forty-nine duplicates; I immediately went over to Rossan, to return them to her - I only looked at them casually, and cannot tell any of the pawnbrokers' names; I went to Clerkenwell to the prisoner, the next day, or the day after - I wrote on a scrap of paper, that I had returned Rossan the duplicates, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ascertain from the prisoner that a man named Robins occasionally slept in the house when he was absent? A. I think he did say so - I cannot say whether he said it was when he was absent; I do not know that Robins has absconded - the prisoner was on a station at Kingsland for four or five months, in the new Police.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he dismissed from the Police? A. I believe he was: I had applied to the superintendent for leave of absence for him, and he did not return.</p>

            . I am a silk stock-manufacturer, and have the care of an uninhabited house in Upper Stamford-street; I am a friend of the prisoner's and his wife - Franklin brought me a message that the prisoner wanted a shawl, a cap, and a few things, which I had in my care: it was a ladies' shawl and cap - I sent them to him by a person; I did not know he was in custody till then - I went to the New prison two or three days after, and received a note from the prisoner, directed to Mrs. Robson, No. 370, Strand- he told me to take it to Mrs. Robson; I gave her the note, and she gave me a parcel, which I gave to Franklin; I did not see him open it - I gave it to him in the street the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the parcel? A. I saw it on the table -Franklin had it open; I was at the other end of the room: I cannot say what it contained, for I did not look at it - it was like small cards; I cannot say whether they were like duplicates - I did not look at them; I saw Franklin tie it up; he then returned it to me - I cannot tell what they were: I saw they were small cards when he opened them, but not when he tied them up; I put them into a cupboard - a man afterwards came to me for them, and I delivered them to him; I am certain I delivered him the same parcel, in consequence of his telling me who he came from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know that the prisoner had a brother named Robins? A. No; I know a man of that name - he was an inmate of the prosecutrix's house: he has absconded since this charge; he was very near the prisoner's height, and of the same complexion - one might easily be mistaken for the other.</p>

               <p>MRS. GIRTON. I am married, and live in Hornsey-road- I am an acquaintance of Miss Hog's. I have seen Robins, but do not think I should know him; I was in the habit of going to Miss Hog's house very frequently during her absence: after the prisoner was discharged from the New Police, he had another situation at the Milbank Penitentiary - he came to live at Miss Hog's house for good about July, and after that I never saw Robins there: I saw the prisoner at the house on the 17th of January, the day before Miss Hog returned - I had been there all day; he went out between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and I waited till twelve o'clock, as I was astonished at his leaving; I had told him before he went out that I wanted his assistance - be did not return; I met a Policeman in Highbury-place, and desired him to watch the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you happen to know that the prisoner was looking about for Robins? A. I cannot possibly say that; I went to Miss Hog's house on an average twice a week during her absence.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You told the prisoner you wanted him that evening at the house? A. I did; I had sent him on an errand to the end of Highbury-place, and expected him home in half an hour; his wife was in the house.</p>

No- he is connected with me by marriage; he is my brother-in-law, and his family are very respectable; he did not bring any knives and forks, with silver ferrules, to my house, not to my knowledge - I saw some in my house; they were not mine, and I sent them back - I spoke to the prisoner about them; I cannot say whether he had brought them, or that Robins did - I had been abroad, and my own property had not returned from the continent, and I was going to have a party, which was the cause of their being there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen Robins? A. Very often - I forbid his coming to my house; I have not seen him since the prisoner has been in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner say who had brought the knives there? A. It is floating in my recollection that he said either he or Robins brought them; the prisoner was at my house almost every day for a fortnight before he was apprehended - he told me he was constantly looking after Robins.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you give the prisoner 1s. 6d. to get the knives repaired? A. I did not myself: I directed it to be given him to get them cleaned; Mr Girton called on me, and the prisoner called the next day - and I sent to Mr. Girton that he had an opportunity of bringing a Policeman if he thought fit, and next day he went with me to Miss Hog's; the prisoner remained outside the door while we went in, and when we came out he was waiting -Mr. Girton prohibited his going in, on account of Miss Hog's nerves.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Machin and others. On the afternoon of the 3rd of April I was in their sale-room, and saw the prisoner take these books up, place them before him, and walk away - they were tied together; he had got about eleven or twelve yards when I stopped him, and delivered him to an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not to be a sale of books the next day? A. Yes - there were a great many persons in the room; it is the custom to inspect the books the day before; the prisoner had not gone out of the room - there were several tables between the place he took the books from and the door; I had seen him before - I do not know whether he has bid at the sales; there is a reward of 10l. to be paid to any one who detects a felony in the room - if the prisoner is convicted I expect to get that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there an opportunity for the prisoner to look at them where they were? A. Yes, but he had removed them about twelve yards - he was perhaps eight yards from the door; they had been on the floor, but there was a table against where they were, and he might have looked at them there; he had them in front of him.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL SMITH MACHIN. I know the place where these books were; there is a table and two shelves - it is the rule for persons to take them from the floor, lay them on the shelf, and examine them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not the custom there for people to put shoes on their feet, and clothes on their backs? A. Yes, on the spot, but if they were to walk down the room with them they would be stopped.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When was the money paid? A. The latter end of December; I applied about my discharge in about a fortnight, but I did not send to Mr. Harmer's office till after the term.</p>

            . I was attorney for the plaintiff in the action against Miss Denning; I never received any money from the prisoner to settle it.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any interviews with him on the subject? A. I had several; he endeavoured to effect a settlement - he said Mr. Harmer's business was of that nature, as to preclude him from entering into such low matters as Miss Denning's, and the whole matter was in his hands; he then said he would draw a cheque for 100l. to settle the business - I advised the plaintiff to take the 100l., and so get clear of the business, but it was refused; I think the prisoner offered to pay 40l. more than once, but the matter was so scandalous, I would not allow any compromise to be made - I always refused to take it; I thought it was all illusory - I forget whether he told me that he had received 40l. from Miss Denning's brother; he never produced a cheque to me - he invited me to attend at Whitecross-street, which I did, and, in Miss Denning's presence, he said he would draw a cheque if I would give her a discharge, and he subsequently offered 40l. at my office.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he say where the money was? A. Yes, I asked where it was, and he said, "At Mr. Harmer's."</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you communicate with the prisoner at Mr. Harmer's? A. Yes, I called, and I fancy the subject was talked of; there was not any concealment - it was my clients who refused the terms. I saw no reluctance on the part of the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Broad-street. In 1829, I employed Mr. Harmer, as my attorney, about some family property, which was disputed; the prisoner attended to that as Mr. Harmer's clerk - on the 18th of January, 1830, it was arranged that some stock should be sold out, and I attended at the Bank, with the prisoner; here is the receipt of the stock that was sold that day - it was 163l.; here is a deduction of 10l. on the back of it, made by Mr. Scholey, the executor, and 20l. the prisoner deducted for Mr. Harmer; this is the bill the prisoner delivered to me, it amounts to 20l. 0s. 8d. - he told me he kept the 20l. to pay that bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the 20l. paid to him? A. No, I saw him pay the money to the executor; Mr. Scholey expected a present - this is the prisoner's writing on the back of the receipt; I cannot tell who wrote the bill of costs, but the prisoner gave it to me - I went to Mr. Harmer's office, and stated to the prisoner, in the presence of the other clerks, that I was going to apply at the Bank to sell out the stock; I did not notice the attendances, which are set down in the bill of costs, at the time it was given to me - I only looked at the amount; the prisoner deducted it, and gave me the balance.</p>

            . I am a clerk to Mr. Harmer. I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings in February, 1830; I think the prisoner had quitted the office about three weeks before - I had, in that interval, been endeavouring to find him; I found a paper in a tea-caddy, or a small box - it is an account at the back of a letter, which is the prisoner's writing; the account, I think, is his brother's writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner quit the service himself? A. To the best of my belief he did; Mr. Harmer gave him notice to go, but he did not wait till the end of the time - Mr. Harmer's business is very extensive; if I wanted money to settle any expences I should go to Mr. Harmer for it, but if he had a client he did not know, he would say, "You had better ask the clients for it;" the accounts are settled every week, but sometimes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050087"/>they are not, as we are at assizes, or on examination - if I received money from any client it would appear in the book when my cash account went in; our rule is to give the accounts in every week, and I think I can swear that not more than a fortnight has ever elapsed without their going in - I do not think that business has gone on for clients of whom Mr. Harmer knows nothing; if any one applied to me I should mention it - there is a bill-book in the office; I never keep drafts of bills, and enter them in the book a long time afterwards - I should say that it has never happened that the clerks have received sums of money above 20l. of clients of whom Mr. Harmer knows nothing; I never heard of any mortgage being taken by Mr. Harmer - it is not the custom for clerks to attend to clients, and not let Mr. Harmer know it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are the clerks allowed to retain any money for occasional disbursements, and to bring it to account afterwards? A. No my Lord; if I received 20l. I should take it to Mr. Harmer, and if I wanted any money I should tell him, and he would give it me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You know where I resided. Witness. Yes- I went to your lodging two or three days after you left the office, and found a number of vans; you had taken a van to go to Surrey, and then to come to Islington - I did not know there were any civil proceedings against you.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES HARMER. I am an attorney. The prisoner was in my service about two years; he quitted me, I think, the first week in February, 1830 - I think he states two weeks in February in his account, but I believe he charged one week more than he attended; his duty was if he received a small sum of money from a client to enter it in the petty cash-book, but if he received a larger sum he was to pay it to Mr. Tomlin, or to me; he certainly never accounted to me for 40l. received from Miss Denning - I did not know that any sum had been received by him till some time afterwards, when I heard it from her brother; he never accounted to me for 20l. received from Mr. Tucker - I did not know it had been received till some time after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has it ever been required of him to give an account of this 40l. or 20l.? A. No, Sir, but when I had reason to suspect him I told him he must make up all his accounts, which he never did - if I had received from him this account found at his house, in which the 20l. appears, and the 40l. had been added to it, I should not have been satisfied, because his duty was to make it known to the cash-clerk that he had received it; I do not look over the accounts of the clerks - I do not recollect that it has ever happened that clerks have received money on account of clients, and have not rendered an account of it, because they had applied it to the purposes of the clients; if they had received a large sum and had a large sum to pay, I should not have complained of it if they had entered it and communicated it to the cash-clerk - if he had not returned an account of the 40l. for two or three days I should not have complained, if there had been any prospect of the matter being settled, but if he rendered an account it should have appeared in it; I never knew of the clerks having received a large sum of which they have not given an account at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a sum of money having been advanced by a clerk to Smallwood, which ended in a mortgage? A. I remember the prisoner applied on behalf of a person named Smallwood, a man in poverty, and I authorized some advances of 2l., to the amount I think of 30l. - I have no recollection of being made acquainted with an intention to sell the stock on this occasion; but finding it was a Chancery business, I introduced Mr. Tucker to Fry, and said, "Attend to this gentleman's business."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner ever communicate to you that he had furnished a bill, and received the money? A. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. But if he had done so, you would not have complained? A. Yes, I should if he had not entered it; I do not see the bill-book once in six months- I should say it does not often happen that bills do not make their appearance in the bill-book; I know there have been two or three cases in which I have had occasion to look for very large bills in my bill-book, and I have found that a great part of them have not appeared in the book, for which I have given a lecture to my clerks.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Supposing the prisoner, on the 22nd of December, to have received 40l., and he made up his account on the 11th of January, ought it to have appeared? A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you mean, Sir, to state, that the first payments I made to Mr. Smallwood were not made without your authority or direction? A. I will not swear that, but I never authorized any clerk of mine to lend money to a client without consulting me - I recollect your stating that the client was in distress, though he had a good and equitable claim - I do not recollect your furnishing me with an account of the receipts and payments in that action; I think you have handed me money received from clients, and I have handed it to Mr. Tomlin - there is another collecting-clerk in the house. Mr. Mills; the book will tell whether he was so in December, 1830; he had no authority to receive money in the office, but to collect from clients - he certainly has never received directions from me to require the clerks to pay to him monies which they received from clients - I cannot tell whether, when you have rendered accounts, the balances have been in your favour; I had been urging for some time before you left, that you should make up your accounts.</p>

            . I am cash-clerk to Mr. Harmer, and was so in 1829 and 1830; it was the rule for the clerks to account to me - the prisoner did so, but he never accounted for 40l. received from Miss Denning; I did not know he had received it till about ten days after he left the office, when I heard it, in Mr. Harmer's private office; Mr. Martin was there at the time. The prisoner never accounted for 20l. received from Mr. Tucker - I heard of that about the same time; I have looked into the bill-book, and there is no such bill as this of Mr. Tucker's, entered there; the prisoner accounted to me on the 31st of January, 1830, in the usual way - here is the book; he gave an account of four items, but the 40l. and 20l. are not brought to account in that, or in any previous settlement - the last time he settled before was on the 12th of December; I had been urging him for his account in the interval.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a balance due to him in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050088"/>last account? A. Yes, 7l. 0s. 6d. on the account he has rendered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then this was longer than a week after he made his former account? A. Yes, it was six weeks - the accounts do sometimes go longer than a week- I should not have allowed clerks to say, "I have received a sum of money, but I have not settled the business yet;" I do not remember that any monies have never been received by the clerks from clients, which have never been entered in the book; I do not remember a sum of 80l. being received from Mr. Morris - I have heard there was a sum of money received on account of Mr. Harmer, in the case of Whitaker; I heard of 20l. which was accounted for to me, but not 520l. - I understood that had been paid to Mr. Whitaker; I never understood that the prisoner received it - I do not know that the prisoner received 80l. on account of Mr. Morris; it may be in the book - the sums on this receipt (looking at one) I know Mr. Harmer gave a cheque for, himself - they were probably both given to the prisoner to pay them; the prisoner had the management of the Chancery business, but it does not follow that if any money was paid he would receive it; it might have been handed to the clients at the time - there have been balances in the prisoner's favour, and on one occasion there was a large balance, but I think never so high as 40l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you produce that book as containing an exact copy of my accounts rendered from time to time to you? A. Precisely so - it contains the whole of the payments you have made to Mr. Harmer; there were balances in your favour - the sums stated in your last account were received in December; I cannot state what disbursements you have made since the receipt of the 40l. - it has been the case that bills have not been entered in the billbook.</p>

            . I am an officer. A warrant was placed in my hands on the 23rd of February, 1830 - I went with it in search of the prisoner - we were up three or four nights, seeking for him; I was at his house when this paper was found over the water, in Surrey - I saw his wife, but I saw nothing of him till I found him at Liverpool, on the 3rd of March last: I took him, and told him the charge against him - I made him no promise or threat; he stated that he was given to understand that the case against him was 300l., and he was sure it was not so much as 100l., or not more than 100l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know that he had a writ against his person and his goods? A. No, Sir; he did not say that Mr. Harmer charged him with being in his debt 300l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you went to my lodging in John-street, did you not hear that I had gone out within an hour? A. I do not recollect that - Mr. Robinson was in the house first; I do not recollect hearing that you were shortly to return - your wife did not tell me where you were.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in an exceedingly long address, stated that the accounts of the office were kept in a very irregular manner; that he was in the habbit of receiving money from clients, and only brought to account the costs, keeping the sums paid by clients to him, as a floating balance, to meet various disbursements; that the only fault he had committed, was having by mistake applied more to his own purposes than his salary amounted to, which arose from the balances remaining in his hand without any settlement, that he absconded in consequence of pecuniary embarrasment, but if a balance had been struck, the amounts in question would have been included.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner on the 23rd of March, near the Golden Cross -I looked at him some time, and thought he answered the prosecutrix's description; I then asked him if he remembered the Cornwall coach stopping on Wednesday week; he said Yes; he then asked me if I wanted a coach or a cab; I said, No, but I should like something to drink; I then asked him if he knew Caroline Prescott; he said No - I took him to where she lived, and asked for her - I said to the prisoner, "You had better walk in doors;" he said, "No, I shan't walk in doors," and he shoved his hat further over his face - the prosecutrix then came, and said, "That is not the man;" I said, "Don't be in a hurry, take a good look at him;" the prisoner then said, "Oh, I will go in doors" - when he got into the front-parlour, I desired him to take off his hat, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050089"/>then she said, "Yes, that is the man, but he wore a cap instead of a hat, and it was a dark cap with a leather front" - I took him to the station-house, and went directly to his lodgings, where I found this cap and comforter - the prosecutrix said this was the cap he wore, and he had a comforter round his neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often did you go before the Magistrate? A. We had three examinations - the Magistrate said there was no case against the prisoner, but we might go before the Grand Jury if we liked; we went, but the Grand Jury at Westminster Court had broken up - the prosecutrix described the prisoner as wearing a black plush waistcoat, with sleeves, a cap with a beak, and black or blue trousers; she did not mention a comforter till this was found.</p>
               <p>CAROLINE PRESCOTT. The cap and comforter answer the description of those he wore, but I cannot swear to them - I swear he is the man.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged eight months with me in Charles-passage, Hungerford-market - he attended at the Golden Cross back gate. I remember that on the 14th of March he had ancle boots on, white stockings, knee breeches. a yellow striped waistcoat, a fustian jacket, and a hat - this cap was found in his box, but I told the officer I never saw him wear it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What dress had the prisoner on the 16th? A. I believe the same dress - it was his general dress; he never wore a cap in my house; I cannot tell why he had a cap which he never wore - I have seen him wear it once or twice on a Sunday; I have seen him with the comforter round his neck.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever see him in possession of a black waistcoat? A. Never, Sir, he has not got a black or a blue waistcoat.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Jones, a surgeon, in the Strand - I am a fellow-townsman of the prisoner's. In the afternoon of the 14th of March, I saw him from three to four o'clock; he is a porter at the Golden Cross- he never holds horses at the House of Lords - on the 14th of March he had ancle boots on, white stockings, corderoy knee-breeches, a striped waistcoat, a deep hat, and a fustian jacket - we went to the Coach and Horses, and had a pint of beer; we were together half an hour, or not so much - he had no comforter on that day; I have seen him wear such a cap as this two or three times, on a Sunday, when my sister and I have been at his lodging, but I never saw him at work with it; I had seen him a day or two before, with a black plush waistcoat, with sleeves, but not dark trousers - there has not been ten days since he has been in London, that I have not seen him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It does not take a man long to change his dress? A. No - I did not know where he was at seven o'clock that evening; I remember the 14th of March, as it was a very wet day - I was remarking to him about his having his breeches on, and I thought trousers would have been more proper.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you never see him in the week day with a cap on? A. Yes, with an old cap, which is here now, but not the one produced by the officer.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see him with this cap? A. I did the morning he bought it, but I never saw it on his head; I have seen him with this old cap - I have seen him wear a comforter, but I do not know whether it was this or another.</p>

The prisoner has been in my employ about twenty-three months; I had reason to suspect him on the 15th of March - I let him go out, and then sent one of my men to tell him I wanted to speak with him - I took hold of the flap of his coat, and he took out of his other pocket, on the left side, a piece of satin and some jean, which had my mark on it; I said, "This is not yours" - he said, "No, it is yours, and I do not know how it came here;" we took him to the office, and then went to his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050090"/>lodgings, where we found a number of other articles, in papers, and some husks, with my initials on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you know whether the prisoner had been in this way of business? A. I know his father was a stay-maker, and I understand he himself has been a publican, and has failed; he first said the articles he had about him were his own, and he had bought them of a person in Crown-court, but did not know his name; I never knew of his cutting out work for himself in my shop - I would not keep a man in my employ who did so; I have had a person in my employ who has had orders for himself, and he has told me of it, and I have let him have goods - this is the jean - it has the prisoners own mark on it. and he acknowledged it was mine, before he went out of the house; a day or two before he had some stays to cut out, and this was the lining of them - it happened to be seven yards long, and the night before, he wanted a little bit - I gave him this to cut the little bit off, and he did not return it - when I found it, he said it must have come into his pocket by mistake; he said at the station, that he lodged at No. 33, Maiden-lane.</p>

            . My husband is a corn-porter: we live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. I am a stay-maker: I stitched and cottoned two pairs of stays for the prisoner - I did all but boneing, and pressing them; these two pairs are my making, to the best of my belief - the pattern is the same, and as far as I can tell, these are the pairs I did for him; I do not know this other pair.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Will you swear positively that the work of these two pairs of stays is yours? A. They appear like it as near as I can tell; I put no private mark on them - the last I made was of this pattern; I have been a stay-maker ten years, and have been accustomed to needle-work all my life.</p>
               <p>MR. HOBSON. This woman worked for me, and when I found she worked for the prisoner, I discharged her.</p>

On the 13th of February the prisoner came to my shop; he said he belonged to a Portuguese vessel - he took a violin out of my window, and asked the price; I told him 2l.; I then showed him another violin and a bow - he asked the price of that; I said 30s.; he then said he belonged to a Portuguese vessel, the Three Sisters, lying in St. Katharine Dock, and was employed by the captain to look out for violias for him; he asked if I would have any objection to let him take the violins to show the captain, if he left above the value of them - I said I had no objection to his taking them, if he left, the full value, if he would bring back the money or the violins, as I would take no goods or any thing of that sort in exchange; I particularly told him that; he then said he would wish to have the property he would leave back again, as it was of more value to him than the violins - he then took out these two shawls from a paper he had under his arm; he knelt down on his right knee, lifted up his two hands, and said, "Pounds more as more as, by Jesus Christ me will not deceive you;" I understood by that 10l.; I then let him have the violins, which were worth 3l. 10s., and he promised to bring back them or the money by three o'clock - he did not return; I did not see him again till the 24th of February, when I met him by accident in Tottenham-court-road; I stopped him, and asked where the violins were - he said he had got them, and I should be sure to have them again; that he had been looking for my shop two or three days, and could not find it - he told me he would give me the violins; he led me on to Cheapside, and opposite Bow church I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did he speak tolerably good English? A. He spoke broken English - I did not bargain with him for a shawl for my wife in lien of one of the violins; I did not take the shawls for the violins - he left them as security; here are the shawls.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had not sold the violins? A. No, my Lord, not without he brought back the money; I gave him to an officer - he ran from him he was pursued, and taken.</p>

I was in Finsbury-square on the 21st of March - I was pressed against several persons, and the prisoner, who was one, put his hand up against me, and in an instant my watch was gone- I caught one who was as near me as the prisoner - I held him as long as I could, and called for assistance, but I got two or three violent blows, and was forced to let him go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a great crowd? A. Yes, and they closed about me - the prisoner shuffled me about; I do not know who pushed him - I do not say he took my watch; I think I should know the features of the man I seized - it was not the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did the prisoner do? A. He put one of his arms up to his throat, and took the watch with his other hand - the prosecutor caught hold of another man; I have worked for the master of St. George's workhouse - I was at the Mansion-house; I did not then say I had been out of employ three months; I had been in employ, but did not work that day, because it was a holiday - I went to see the victuals given away, but there was none; I was was close to the prisoner - he trod on my foes; I did not seize him, for fear of my own head - he had not done any thing to me, but I saw him attempt several persons; I did not see an officer at the time near me, or I should have told him of it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did the prisoner cease to reside in Charlotte-street? A. As near as I can say, about the beginning of November, 1829.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Did you remain with him till he left that place? A. I did; I never saw him there after Mr. Dodson came - I remained there; I do not know exactly how long Dodson might have been in the house when the name was removed - I cannot say whether it was there at all after Dodson came; the prisoner had no shop - there was a surgery where we made up medicines for patients, which were entered to them in the day-book, and then posted into the ledger; the bills were made out, and some of them, I think, were paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did persons come to the house to buy drugs? A. A person named Sherman, a surgeon, once ordered medicines at our house, which he had made up for him; they were entered in the day-book to him - he lived in the house with the prisoner the latter part of the time, but not at that time; he was in the habit of coming occasionally - he visited some of the prisoner's patients, and gave directions during his absence.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it before or after he came there, that he ordered medicines for his own patients? A. I think it was while Mr. Holtom lived in the house; sherman then lived in Park-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. While you were there, did anybody come to buy any thing? A. I never sold any thing, nor do I know of any thing being sold to person who came.</p>

            . I am a widow, and lived in Lower John-street, Commercial-road. A person, who went by the name of Captain Mitchell, took apartments at my house the latter end of 1829; the prisoner used to visit him, and when he first came to my house, he (the prisoner) left his name as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050095"/>Captain Miller - Mitchell left my house at two o'clock one Sunday afternoon, to go to France, and left a paper, signed"Captain Hall;" I never spoke to the prisoner about it - the prisoner always answered to the name of Miller; I am certain of the prisoner's person - he had not mustachios when he visited at my house; he used to wear a blue frock coat - he (the prisoner)had a quantity of boxes at my house; I saw him open one case - it contained horse harness; there was a hamper of medicine - he took the medicine out of it, and put it into a wooden box; I heard him say he had a phaeton, which he wanted to place at the George, half-way-house, Commercial-road - the week before Mitchell left my house, a van of property was brought there, and a backney-coach came on the Saturday-night; the prisoner told me he was going to France, in the steam packet, with Mitchell and his wife, who he called Mrs. Miller - Mitchell left my house in a backney-coach, the very same morning as the prisoner left; Mitchell used to carry pistols in his pocket - I never saw the prisoner with any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you fix the date of his leaving on Sunday morning? A. I am sure it was the latter end of November, 1829.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. You cannot recollect whether it was on the 22nd? A. I cannot - the prisoner did not bring the van of goods.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the box he opened come in the van? A. Yes; he told me it was medicine - there were bottles and jars.</p>

            . I am a solicitor - Mr. Dodson was a client of mine. In October, 1829, in consequence of an advertisement, I saw the prisoner, and entered into a negociation with him for the purchase of his business as a surgeon and apothecary, in Charlotte-street, Portland-place; the purchase was completed - Mr. Dodson was a young man; the prisoner was to remain in the house for three weeks after the purchase - I believe that part of the arrangement was inserted in the written agreement, which I have not got; I saw him at the house on the Monday after the treaty was completed, which was on Saturday - (I have ceased to be Mr. Dodson's solicitor, and have given up all the papers;) this was on the 16th of November - the prisoner's name remained on the door for three or four weeks after that; it was taken down some time after the docket was struck - I only saw him in the house two days after the treaty was completed; I was present at a conversation between Dodson and the prisoner that day; Mr. Dodson asked him when he would pay him the 118l. which he owed him - he said he had got nothing but bankers' bills, but that he was going into the City the next morning, and would either pay Mr. Dodson, or call at my house and leave it with me - at this time the prisoner wore more the habit of a quaker than any thing else; he was not like a captain - I never saw him after that Monday; I struck a docket against him on the 24th of December - we endeavoured to arrest him first, but could not; immediately we found he had gone abroad we struck the docket - that was our reason for striking it; I am not aware that the debt of 118l. had any reference to the negociation about the business; he had told me on the 3rd of November that the debt he owed Dodson should be paid on the completion of the business - the amount was then mentioned as 118l.; it had then been agreed that Dodson should have the business, for which 700l. in all was to be paid - Dodson's mother was to pay for the business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. The debt the prisoner acknowledged he owed Dodson was 118l.? A. I believe it was - I understood so from Dodson and from the bankrupt; I am not aware that Dodson and the prisoner were acquainted previous to my answering the advertisement - I think I first saw them together in September - I think it was after I had written to the prisoner respecting this purchase; Dodson was not above twenty-two or twenty-three years old.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was to be given for the business? A. I do not know - several arrangements were made, and alterations; Holtom first asked 400l. for the business and lease, but an alteration was made and a valuation, and the sum actually paid was 700l., including fixtures, wine, and furniture - I cannot tell the particular items; they were all classed together - I believe I wrote Mrs. Dodson one or two letters; I know Mr. Dodson was living respectably, and believe he was able to lend 118l. - I am attesting witness to the agreement; it was not stamped - (Looking at four letters) these are my handwriting; I was present when Mr. Camphell, a friend of Mrs. Dodson's, paid the 700l., on behalf of Messrs. Postlethwaite, her bankers, on Saturday, the 14th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do not you know that the difference between the first agreement and the second was just 118l? A. Not that I am aware of; I never knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the second agreement was a fraudulent one, made for the purpose of deceiving Mrs. Dodson, to get the 118l.; and that it was 118l. more than the real purchase-money? A. I do not; I never knew it from Dodson or any body; there was a different arrangement made, and I was informed by both parties, that the sum to be inserted in the deed was 700l.; and, to the best of my knowledge, that was the bona fide sum for the purchase; Mr. Dodson went up to take possession of the business on Saturday, the 14th: the prisoner was to introduce him to his patients for three weeks at least.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was a verbal arrangement entered into as to the time Holtom was to remain on the premises after the valution? A. Certainly; he agreed to reside on the premises for three weeks from the 14th of November Mr. Dodson was merely to lodge with him during that time.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When the 700l. was paid to the prisoner, was any demand made on him for the 118l.? A. No; we were at Mr. Campbell's house in Friday-street, Cheapside; Mr. Campbell handed the money to Holtom, in Dodson's presence and in mine - I went to my office; I believe Dodson and the prisoner went to Charlotte-street together - the money was paid in bankers' acceptances, and on Monday the prisoner said he was going into the City next morning, and would leave the amount with me or pay Dodson.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. About three weeks or a month before the prisoner's final settlement with Mr. Dodson, he told me he was in difficulties, and was about selling his business, and wished to gain time with his creditors till he had sold it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050096"/>Q. Did he ever make any request to you? A. He asked me to allow him to bring some boxes to my house, ashe was going to Van Dieman's Land; I agreed - some boxes and trunks came to my house in Aldermanbury; there might be a dozen boxes and one or two portmanteaus - on a Sunday afterwards he told me the business between him and Dodson had been settled on the Saturday; he wished the boxes to remain at my house - he gave no other reason than that my house was nearer the docks, and he had given up his premises; I know one Jordan was a creditor of his - I suspected the prisoner was about to leave the country, and at my request Jordan came to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. Did you go to his house in Charlotte-street, after he told you the business was settled? A. Not to my recollection; the plate, with his name on it, was brought to my house very shortly before the prisoner went away; the last time I saw him was the Monday evening following the Saturday on which he said the business was settled - I believe he brought the plate himself; I know Mr. Dodson, but did not then.</p>

               <p>MR. CATLIN re-examined. I was present before the commissioners at the time of the adjudication; (the witness proved that the several commissioners qualified, &amp;c.); I attended the third meeting - the bankrupt did not surrender at any of the meetings; I attended till three o'clock, and heard him proclaimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CALARKSON. Q. Was you Dodson's attorney when he made an affidavit of debt against the bankrupt? A. Certainly; I prepared all the proceedings, and became his attorney when he acted as assignee - he was removed afterwards; I did not appear for him in the Court of Chancery - he has since taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act; I opposed his discharge for his creditors, not on my own behalf - he was in my debt; I was his attorney till about eight months before he took the benefit of the Act - I never knew of there being two valuations made in this negociation; there were several arrangements - the original valuation of Mr. Close's was not altered that I am aware of; there was a different arrangement altogether after the valuation - I never heard that 118l. of the purchase money was to be repaid to Dodson; I believe there was some wine in the house - I am not aware, at this length of time, whether I ever told the prisoner on no account to mention to Dodson about the wine - (looking at a letter) this is in my writing - there was no secret transaction about the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever write to the prisoner, "Do not say a word to Dodson about the wine; I shall insert it in the agreement, and then inform him upon execution that I agreed to take it for him with the furniture?" A. If I have written that in the letter, I have; I am not aware how it could have arisen; (looking at the letter) if this be my writing I did write so; it is my writing - I am not aware what it relates to, or what may have been my motive, at this lapse of time - Dodson went over the stock; the only reason I can suppose is that Dodson must have objected to take the wine, it being a larger stock than he required; he was my client - I cannot say what quantity of wine there was; there was a very large quantity I know - I can give no reason for writing this, except that he would very likely object to take so large a stock - (letter read).</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - I hasten to enclose you a letter I have received from my client, Mr. Dodson, by which you will perceive he will be here to settle the business on Monday or Tuesday; as soon as he arrives my clerk shall come and inform you what hour he will wait on you to look over the books, and satisfy himself about the business - we will then return here, and enter into the agreement. - Do not say a word to Dodson about the wine; I shall insert it in the agreement, and then inform him, on execution, that I agreed to take it for him with the furniture. - You know I am perfectly satisfied about the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have any honest reason for writing that? A. Holtom made it part of the arrangement that the wine should be taken; I had no opportunity of seeing Dodson, and presume I wrote the letter to state I would agree to take the wine, and insert it in the agreement and get Mr. Dodson's consent to take it - his consent was obtained before the agreement was signed.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. Then why did you wish the prisoner not to tell him about it? A. Because I would explain it to him- I did not mean to entrap him; if he objected I would take it all myself, and I did - he objected to take so much- I said I would take the rest at a valuation; no regular quantity was inserted in the agreement.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, "You know I am perfectly satisfied about the business, and you score the letter I?" A. I was satisfied myself about the purchase of the business, and it was subject to the approval of Mr. Dodson; this letter is my writing - (read.)</p>
               <p>To R. Holtom, Esq.</p>
               <p>October 28th., 1820.</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - I have seen Mr. Postlethwaite, who has been here, and will have the money ready; I have given him a letter of introduction to you - he will call; recollect the purchase-money 400l., valuation of fixtures 27ll. 10s., medicines 28l. 10s. - do not let him see your agreement: he has seen the one signed by you; I enclose you a note I have this instant received from Dodson, by which he fears Postlethwaite will write to Mrs. Dodson before the business is closed, but if you tell him you must have the business closed to-morrow, it will be done; do not let this letter be seen - tell Postlethwaite you must have the agreement completed to-morrow, in consequence of the illness of your wife.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, on your oath, was his wife ill at that time? A. I am sure I cannot tell; if I have written that, I believe she was ill, but I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by "Do not let Postlethwaite see your agreement?" A. Because I presumed Dodson had made a different arrangement with him than the first agreement alluded to - a paper was signed by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. We have no evidence of the petitioning creditor's debt but this witness; if the Court think his evidence is doubtful, I will withdraw from the prosecution.</p>

On the 20th of February they came, and my mother asked them to stop to tea; my mother showed them a lace tippet which laid on the sofa - they said it was very handsome; my mother then put it into a drawer, and went out to get some tea; Pearson then asked me to show Nash the wash-house and back garden, but she did not go - I went down, leaving them in the room; when my mother came back they had tea, and went away about six o'clock; we missed the collar in a few minutes - I made inquiries, and found where Nash lived; I went and charged her with it - she denied it, and I called the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner, and got the duplicates from the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>MRS. BULL. These are my property; the prisoner had been upwards of three months with her nephew and niece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were these things never pawned to pay your rent? A. Not to my knowledge; I had seen the prisoner's husband come there, but not after these goods were gone - I said I had no wish to prosecute, if I could get my things, and I was offered the money - this is the letter I received (read.)</p>
               <p>MADAM, - It is with feelings of very great pain I now address you, but I can assure you it was distress and trouble made me leave your house, and induced me to act in the way I have done; but you may rely on it, as I hope to be saved, in a very short time, I will pay you, and make all things right. I cannot say more, but you shall hear from me again very soon.</p>
               <p>Your's, obediently, J. TETSOLL.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My niece was very ill, and I went there now and then; they were in great distress, and were in the habit of pawning the things the whole year round - they pawned these things to pay the rent, or Mrs. Bull said she would play the deuce with them; they expected 10l. of a gentleman, who owed them 30l. - I did not know of their going away.</p>

At a quarter-past seven o'clock on the evening of Wednesday, the 14th of March, Thompson came to our shop, offered this shawl, and wanted 10s. on it; I asked whose it was - she said Mrs. Smith's, No. 3, over the way; I said there was no such number there - she then said down King-street, No. 3, or No. 9; I put the shawl under the counter, sent: for the Policeman, and gave her in charge - this is it; Blumson came to our house, and said, "Have you not sent a woman to the station-house?" I said Yes; he said, "I bought the shawl about two years ago;" I said, "The pattern has not been up so long;" he then said it was eighteen months ago, and he bought it of a man at his door - he then asked me the value of it; I said about 2l. 10s. - he said,"That is what I gave for it."</p>

On Sunday morning, the 11th of March, I saw the prisoner and three others near one another - I knew them, and told Wood, who was with me, that something was wrong; I saw four pots standing at Mr. Ponsonby's rails - I watched some time, and saw the other three go away; I followed them some distance, and then ran round to find the prisoner - Wood gave me information; I took the prisoner, and found two pots in his hat and two on his person.</p>

            . I am a baker; I live five doors from Miss Meyer. I went into the house to smoke my pipe; while I was there Miss Meyer told me of this, and said it was not all right - she then went out, came in again, and said,"They are stripping the child;" I went out, and Ewen had come away - I saw Bartlett and the child on the ground: I said to Ewen, "What have you been doing to that child?" he said nothing; I pulled his coat aside, and took these boots from him - he said a boy gave them to him; I got a man to look for Bartlett, but he was gone; a young man took the child, and I took the boots to the officer, who found the parents.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050105"/>the hat intending to purchase it, but being rather inebriated it fell from his hand. He received a good character.</p>

            . I was going down Pollard's-row, about half-past six o'clock, and saw Perry driving a little chaise cart, with the flour in it; I walked alongside of him I suppose, five hundred yards; an elderly man followed the cart, and crossed the way - I cannot swear to him, but I can to Perry.</p>

               <p>Perry's Defence (written). On the evening of the 16th of February, as I was standing in Cammomile-street, Bishopsgate, a respectable looking man came and asked if I was not the person who drove Mr. Smith's horse and cart; I told him I was; he then told me that he wanted me to remove a few goods for him on the following morning, at six o'clock, which I said I would do - he came the next morning, got into the cart with me, and told me to drive to Bethnal-green-road, which I did; when I came to Pollard's-row, he told me to drive down there, and stop under a loft window - he then, with two other men, who were in the loft, loaded my cart with five sacks out of the loft; he told me to follow him, which I did, till I was about half-way down Fashion-street, Spitalfields; he then told me to stop while he went over the way - he almost instantly returned, and said that the person the goods were for had removed, and I must wait while he went back to get his direction; while he was gone I got up on the cart to tie up one of the sacks, and three Policemen came up and asked me where the owner of the sacks was; I told them he was in the house opposite; they went in and brought him out, but let him make his escape.</p>
               <p>Creamer's Defence. Two men came to inquire for a baker who had lodged with me; I said he was gone, but I could give them a direction where to find him - I was about doing so when the officer came and took the man who was waiting for the direction; they let him go, and then came and took me - the cart stood opposite my door; the baker had instructed me to give any one his direction who might call for it - I did not know what the sack contained; I did not come outside my own shop - the shutters were up; I did not say the flour was my property - I have the shop and parlour, and have no communication with the rest of the house.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 1st of April, 1826, the prisoner came home from half-past twelve to one o'clock at night; I opened the door, but told him not to come in till I had got to bed - but directly I got in he rushed into the room, said he was very cold, and begged of me to let him warm himself by the fire; I sat up in my bed, and begged him to take the candle and go to bed, but instead of that he turned it upside down in the candlestick, and begged me to let him sit a bit; he laid his head down, and pretended to be asleep - I was angry with him for putting out the candle: I have a double sel of man lodging there, who work at the gas-works - I still sat up in the bed, but dozed off to sleep - when I awoke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050107"/>he had put out the fire with a tea-kettle of water, and I heard him at the handles of my drawers; I asked who was there - he made no answer: I got out of bed, and put my hands nearly to him - he said, "Don't be frightened, mistress, it is me, I won't hurt you:" I said, "What business have you here?" he said he could not get out - I said, Nonsense; he then went out, and I heard him go up the first flight of stairs - I heard no more till a little before three o'clock, when I heard somebody go out - I did not get out of bed when I heard the prisoner at my drawers; I was on my knees at the foot of the bed, and when I felt him he laughed at me - I did not alarm my husband, as I did not know he had taken any thing; when I heard somebody go out I thought it was a man who worked at the gas, but no other man went out that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he were in the dark, feeling his way out, would he not be very likely to brush against the drawers? A. Yes, that was what I thought he did do - I locked the door when I heard him go out a little before three o'clock, but not when he went out of my room - I did not go to sleep after he went out; I made a complaint to the officer, but I did not go before a Magistrate till the prisoner was found, which was on the 26th of March last - he owed us some money; he had been out of work some time, and we kept him - he had promised to bring us a sovereign that night; I never said I would be revenged on him, nor that I would do for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was it you lost? A. A silver watch, a steel chain, a kersey mere striped waistcoat, a pair of brown duck trousers, some caps, and 2s. 5d. - I had not been out of the room from the time I saw the watch safe; I missed it before six o'clock, when my husband came in for some halfpence, and they were gone from off the table where they had been - I am sure no one had been in the room from the time I saw the watch safe till the prisoner came - I suppose he left the room by twenty minutes after two o'clock; I knew a man would go out a little before three, and I thought with one getting up I would lock both doors.</p>

When we were at Buck by wharf, a brown-paper parcel was put on board by Mr. William Worster - it was placed under the tarpauling, and well secured down; I employed the prisoner to assist us from Paddington, through Islington-tunnel, to the warehouse in the <placeName id="t18320405-261-crimeloc1533">City-road</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Where did you take the prisoner on board? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe the prisoner was very much in your confidence? A. I put every trust in her; she usually sits in the bar-parlour with me, as she attends the bar - I have played at cards with her - I am fond of spirits; we all know our faults; I do not get tipsy - I am not compelled to tell what quantity I take; I never accused my husband of putting these things into the prisoner's box; I never said to him,"You wretch, you put these things in the girl's box" - she frequently sat up all night with me when we had heavy dinners; I have slept in the same room as her; I never stuck my husband in the hand out of jealousy of the prisoner - she did not give me warning to quit; I never said I would hang her if I could - I had a great deal of plate which she could have taken.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The writing on the paper the pencils are in, is my own. Witness. I am confident it is the writing of a servant I had in my employ; I know the paper the brushes are in; I know the long badger hair brushes from the manner of their manufacture - I never sold them, and cannot be mistaken in them; I could point them out among one thousand; and I never saw such twine as this in London.</p>

I carried on business as a brush-maker in Somersetshire for several years, and was cryer to the Court of Quarter Sessions there, but from unforeseen circumstances, was obliged to give up business and my situation; the pencils are part of the stock I had left, and the paper the goods are in I bought of Mr. Hasty, opposite where I lodge - the writing on it is my own - the four brushes are my own manufacture; as to the string, I bought it of a hawker in the street, in exchange for other goods.</p>

On the 17th of March I was at Chelsea, at the committee meeting of a benefit society; I had 16s. 6d. in my pocket when I left the public-house - I was perfectly sober; it had just turned eleven o'clock when I left; I thought it too late to return to Harrow - I saw a young woman in the street, who directed me to a lodging in <placeName id="t18320405-283-crimeloc1660">Royal Hospital-row</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did you take 8s. from a strange man? A. Because I had no money, and was obliged to return to Harrow, or lose my place; he called himself the prisoner's brother - it was given not to appear against them the next day; I told him I was obliged to go down to Harrow, and promised not to appear - I am married - the benefit society meet at the Green Dragon; they do not let beds there; I have no doubt the woman who directed me to the lodging was a prostitute; she took me to the room which she said she had to let - she had the key of the room - it is on a straight stair-case, leading to rooms, without any outer door; she lighted a candle, and left me; I did not put the candle out; I considered the first man who came in a respectable man - I was afraid to ask him to help me secure the prisoners; he said he was owner of the room; I said then I had been deceived - I had him taken to the watch-house, thinking as both ran away down stairs, they were both bad; I never said I could not swear to the man who took the money - a woman was present when I took the 8s. - that is her (looking at a woman named Graham): I did not say in her presence that I could not swear to the man - I have been a witness in this Court twenty or thirty times, or I may say fifty; I belonged to Bow-street at that time; I have been here once since I left Bow-street; Mr. Birnie discharged me from Bow-street, because it was my duty to be up all night at the office, and a gentleman came and asked my assistance in recovering his daughter who was going to be taken away - I left the office with him; Sir Richard was angry, and discharged me; the gentleman was a musician in Lord Liverpool's service -I was never prosecuted on any account; I could not tell that the woman I asked for a lodging was a prostitute - she was talking to another girl.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did any familiarities take place between you and her? A. None at all; I did not expect to see her again - Graham gave the man the 8s, which he gave to me; I took it as part of what I had lost.</p>
               <p>Wood. He said he could not swear to me. Witness. I never said so, nor any thing of the kind; I did not say the girl who took the room sent the man up to rob me, nor that I had treated her with brandy-and-water.</p>
               <p>Wood. I had been drinking with that woman all that day, and the prosecutor met her and gave her drink. Witness. The prisoner is not the girl who was with her.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I saw the prisoner Jones running away from the prosecutor about one o'clock at night; the prosecutor called out Police, Stop him! this was about fifty or sixty yards from the house - I ran across, and asked the prosecutor what was the matter; in consequence of what he said, I followed the prisoner up a court, and found another man there; he parted from Jones, and jumped over a wall; I laid hold of the other man first - I knew a house Jones frequented; I went there, knocked at the door, and the female prisoner's brother said, "Who is there?" I found Jones in the house, laying down by the door with his clothes on -Wood then flew out, and laid hold of me; she bit my knuckles - Jones then collared me; I sprang my rattle, and had a hard matter to secure him; my hand was bound up for a fortnight - this woman's name is not Graham, but Dockerty; the prosecutor charged the prisoners with this offence, and the man who jumped over the wall, with not assisting him to recover his money; the magistrate discharged him when Jones was committed; he told the prosecutor he would murder him - the prosecutor gave the same account at the watch-house as he has now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Snowsell quite sober? A. He was; the house he was robbed at is not a notorious house; there are some respectable people lodge in it, and about two women of the town; I never knew any body go into that room - there may be twenty rooms in the house; I have not been looking for the woman the prosecutor met in the street; I know her, she is a prostitute, but does not walk the streets - she lives with a man they call her husband, and he is the man I took for ordering the prosecutor out of the room - I found a knife on that man, but no money.</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence. I knew nothing of the robbery. Snowsell perjured himself on the trial of Richard Cummins, in 1825.</p>
               <p>Wood's Defence. I am innocent.</p>

On the 22nd of March I left the prisoner, who I knew before, at my house, about nine o'clock in the morning, when I went to my mother's; I returned at seven in the evening - she was then gone: I missed some Irish linen that night, and the next day I missed the shawl and these other articles.</p>

             (Police-constable L 84.) I took the prisoner - she was wearing this shawl at the time, and had this basket in her hand, containing the tablecloth and other articles - she was then in Blackfriars, more than a mile from the prosecutrix's.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She asked me to go and help her wash the next day - I saw her the night before, drinking with a man in a public-house, and that morning she said she had been out all night, drinking, and was not able to go to washing - I took the things to get washed by Sunday.</p>
               <p>MRS. FRUCHARD. I did not ask her to help me - I was going to wash on the day I lost these things; she came to me that morning, and I asked her to have a cup of tea, because she was in distress - I had asked her the night before to call on me: I left her taking breakfast, while I went to my mother's, in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know where she lived? A. No; I had no conversation with her about washing - my daughter had not desired her to get them washed; they were in a pan where I keep dirty linen - I had been out to try to get my mother into the poorhouse; my husband was at home, and at work.</p>

            . (Police-constable T 35) I received the prisoners from the two witnesses; I had before that seen them watching the shop, and when I returned back, they were given to me - Smith had the cloak in his apron, but denied knowing the other prisoner; he said he had committed the offence, and he must suffer for it.</p>
               <p>Smith put in a written Defence, pleading distress - a witness, who gave him a good character, engaged to take him into his service.</p>
               <p>SMITH - GUILTY. Aged 25.</p>

The prisoner lodged with me; she came home on Monday night, the 2nd of April, and said she had got some coral drops to take to be carved for her master - she asked my daughter to go with her, and she went away directly; I did not see her again till Wednesday - I said, "What have you done?" she began to cry, and said she was very sorry - I said, "You had better go to the station-house, your master and mistress have been here;" she was in great distress.</p>

The prisoners came there together at twelve o'clock at night, on the 4th of April; there were two others in company with them, and they called for four basins of soup - they sat in the box in which the prosecutor sat asleep; I noticed them - Allen came in with a straw hat on; he went out with a black one - I went to look at the prosecutor, who lodges with me, and his hat was gone from the table where it had been laying; I suspected the prisoners, and went after them - I saw an officer, and described the parties; he brought Allen back first, and then got Murphy - the prosecutor was still asleep.</p>
