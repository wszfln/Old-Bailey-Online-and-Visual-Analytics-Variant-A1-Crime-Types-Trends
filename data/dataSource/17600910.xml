            . I was by when the prisoner was seized, and I took care of him while Mr. Glass went for a constable. As soon as the bundle was brought into the house, and pitch'd down, the prisoner said it was his bundle. I ask'd him in particular if it was his; he said it was. After he was secur'd, he then own'd he had robb'd his lodgings. I ask'd him, if any others were concerned with him; he said there were two men, but he did not know their names.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where his lodgings were?</p>
               <p>Boote. He said they were at Waltham.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fell, a pawnbroker, I took in this pottage pot about 9 in the morning, on the 23d of July, the prisoner brought it to pledge with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he ask upon it?</p>
               <p>Harrison. I lent him half a guinea on it; about 2 hours after he brought another, and asked half a guinea upon that; I ask'd him whose it was; he said it was his brother's; I told him I must see his brother; he carried me about for about 2 hours, but no brother did I see, nor did he carry me to any body that own'd it; then I took him before justice Welch; there he confess'd where he stole them both. Then I went and acquainted Mr. Clackstone with his, and the constable went to the other prosecutor.</p>
               <p>The prisoner being call'd upon to make his defence; he produc'd a paper, desiring it might be read; which was to this purport.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, the prisoner at the bar humbly begs leave to say in his defence, that being prevailed upon to drink to excess by some company, he unfortunately met with on the day in which he is charg'd with having committed the facts alledged against him in the indictment; and not being accustomed to drink in that manner, his senses were so far intoxicated thereby, that he cannot recollect any thing of the affair; and having nothing farther to urge in his defence, he humbly submits his case to your Lordship and this honourable court, on whose candour he begs leave entirely to rely.</p>

I desired her to sit down, and if any body came in for her to awake me; I thought I could have trusted her, and while I was fast asleep, my hand, with my wedding ring on my finger, being on the outside the bed, she took my ring off, it was rather too big for my finger, and she took the other things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100006"/> mentioned, and went away; when I awaked I miss 'd her and them.</p>

I might sleep near 3 hours; I awak'd before my husband came in; I was so astonished at missing my shoes and buckles, and ring, that I did not look for the other things till after my husband came home. After this, the prisoner had the impudence to come the next night, and went up stairs to bed, knowing I had beds in the house; I had her secur'd and taken to the watchhouse, and they let her go again; and I being ill, could not get her again for several days; when I charg'd her with taking them, she own'd, she went to pawn the things that same afternoon that she took them.</p>

               <p>Last monday was 5 weeks I went to the prosecutrix's house for work, my child was sick, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100007"/> I us'd to work at her house, but I had then work from her at home, and I staid at home on the monday to wash my cloaths; she had given me a waistcoat to make, she measured 5 yards of binding, I took and wrapp'd that about it; I ask'd her to lend me some money; she said she had no change; I went to the sign of the king of Prussia's head joining to her house, and got 2 sixpences for a shilling; I had laid my parcel on a bench at the door, then I took it and went home; and when I came to open it, instead of one waistcoat there was two; I finished one and carried it home, and she paid me; I kept the other at home to employ me at night, and on saturday mornings I was finishing my work, and when I came home she had a great dispute with her work-women. I said, if you please to give me a waistcoat to do I will be running the lining in; she fetch'd me one; she came about five hours after, and told me I had taken four pieces for the backs of waistcoats; I said I knew nothing of them, and went with her to her house. Then she said, she believed they were left on the back of a chair, and were lost. The sunday after she came again, and the other woman with her, then I was finishing the waistcoat, which came to 13 d. which I made an account to carry home to her; I thought it was a stranger coming up, made me hide the lining under the bed quilt: she said, this is the lining my mistress has lost, and I had robb'd her of it; I said you are an impudent saucy slut, I have not, you shall not risle my room upon a sunday, nor make an uproar. She took the sleeves and threw them out at the window, and said, mistress come up this minute, for here is the waistcoat. I said let your mistress in, I did not know what I said or did; I said, for God's sake Mrs. Druit do not make an uproar; they took the waistcoat, and carried it away by force; and the next morning I went to go to the house, and met a woman that lives in Whitechapel; she said Mrs. Druit has got a warrant against you for stealing a waistcoat, value 8 s. she swore before the justice she never gave me a bit of work home.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you give her any work home?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Yes; but I did not give her this home.</p>
               <p>A witness. I am the prisoner's sister, Mrs. Druit brought her to my house, and said she had found two waistcoats at her lodgings; she has employ'd her many a sunday, and her child being sick, she gave her work home.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Witness. Mrs. Druit told me, that she had often given her work home.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Druit. I said I had found a waistcoat upon her, which she was making, and it gives me a great deal of reason to suspect she has got a ready made one that I miss.</p>

               <p>Shaw. I found them again that day at 2 pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q What did you find, and where?</p>
               <p>Shaw. I found the black bonnet, my wife's apron, the table cloth, and a shirt of mine at Henry Day's house.</p>

               <p>Shaw. Yes, she did; and used to scower my pots sometimes.</p>

               <p>Michael Addis. The prisoner at the bar lodged at my house, she went away about the 10th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lodged with you?</p>
               <p>Addis. She had lodged with me about three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lodgings ready furnished?</p>
               <p>Addis. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. At what per week?</p>
               <p>Addis. At 2 s. and 3 d. per week.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you miss the things?</p>
               <p>Addis. We missed the tea-kettle about 3 weeks before she left her lodgings, but we were not willing to mention it, thinking she would bring it back again; when we were informed she was about to leave her lodgings; she came home about eleven o'clock, she would not let my wife go into the room, and begged and cried we would not charge the watch with her; and said, if we would let her go to bed, she would make us satisfaction for what things were missing the next morning; but the next morning she went away, and took the key of the room with her, and we did not see her for four months after, then we found her in another lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she propose to make satisfaction for the things mentioned in the indictment?</p>
               <p>Addis. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let her go away?</p>
               <p>Addis. We live in another house, and we expected she would call upon us, but she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she go away?</p>
               <p>Addis. About eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with her again?</p>
               <p>Addis. We found her in Leather-lane, at the Queen's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get the things again?</p>
               <p>Addis. No, Mr. Fielding was pleased to be so good as to indulge her for two or three days, but she never restored them.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had restored them should you have prosecuted her?</p>
               <p>M. Hawkins. No, we should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if she had let you have your things again should you have been satisfied?</p>
               <p>M. Hawkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Hawkins. I am wife to the prosecutor, the prisoner at the bar lodged at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let her the lodgings?</p>
               <p>Eliz Hawkins. I did, at 2 s. and 3 d. per week, ready furnished.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she come in?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Hawkins. She came in about August last.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she live in that lodging?</p>
               <p>E. Hawkins. About 3 or 4 months; she went away about the 10th of February; I went up to ask her for rent about three weeks before she went away, and then I miss'd my tea-kettle; when I could not find it I ask'd her after it; she said she had taken it to a neighbour's house for some water; I desired her to bring it back again; she told me she would; but I never saw her after that for three weeks; I went to the person where she said it was, and she said there was no tea-kettle there; I had insisted upon going into the room to see my goods; she said they were very safe in the room, and that I had no right to go into the room; I said I had a right, as she did not pay me her rent. After some time she would admit me to go into the room, provided I would let her lie there that night, and not turn her out; then I miss'd the things mentioned; she bid me not to make myself uneasy, for she had a sister that would see them all put into their places before she went out of the room, and she would take me to her; she said where she liv'd; but when I went I could find no such person; she got up the next morning and went away, and I never saw her till three weeks after, till she was taken up on the 22d of July; then she said she intended<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100009"/> to get the things again, for she could get 20 or 40 shillings per week, but she never brought them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a single or a married woman?</p>
               <p>E. Hawkins. She came to me as a single woman; she said she could better pay me than if she had a husband; but before the justice she said her husband came to see her, and he was going abroad, and he bundled them up together and gave them to a person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her husband?</p>
               <p>E. Hawkins. No; I never saw any husband she had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I liv'd opposite them with my husband; he went away with another woman.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Do you know of her living opposite you?</p>
               <p>E. Hawkins. She told me she had lived there, I never knew her till she came to live with me; I have heard since that she did live there; when we took her, we took her from out of a bed with a man, but she did not pretend to say that was her husband; she told the justice her husband was dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband was living then, he was a soldier, he took the things, and put them into another woman's lap, and he and she went away together.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never saw no man come after her, except a person that said he had had her under cure for a bad distemper; he said she ow'd him some money.</p>

               <p>Q. When did the prisoner come to lodge with you?</p>

               <p>Q. What was she to give per week?</p>
               <p>Kealy. My wife told me 2 s. per week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say so?</p>
               <p>Kealy. I did, she said it was agreed upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lodgings ready furnished?</p>
               <p>Kealy. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you upon your oath say, these goods were in her lodging room?</p>
               <p>Kealy. No, I cannot; I did not see them there; I asked the prisoner what she had done with the blanket and sheets; she tol d me she had pawn'd them, and she would take them out of pawn the saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you ask her this?</p>
               <p>Kealy. This was in my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take them out on the Saturday.</p>

               <p>Jones. The prisoner work'd for me 13 years; I had no suspicion of her till a little before last Christmas; some of those things have been missing a year and half; I know she was very poor, and I gave her leave to come into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Jones. These mentioned in the indictment were part of them found in the prisoner's lodgings by a search warrant from justice Fielding, and part were found at Mrs. Blackiters, and part at Mrs. Curtis's, the high constable was with me at her lodgings when I found some upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you buy it?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. I think it was before Christmas, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she had them?</p>

               <p>Q. to M. Blackiter. What did you give her for that?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. To the best of my knowledge I gave her 3 l. 7 s. for that and some gause.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she say she come by that?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. She said she was a lady's woman; and that the lady was going to be married, and she gave her them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. I have known her almost 7 years.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. My husband is a baker, I have trusted her in my shop, and looked upon her to be an honest person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This witness bought a gown of me, and paid Mr. Jones for it, it was a silveret.</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. I bought a piece of the prisoner, and paid Mr. Jones for it afterwards in his shop.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is not said in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I mention this, to shew Mr. Jones trusted me to sell things.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Blackiter. When did you buy that piece you mentioned?</p>
               <p>M. Blackiter. I think it was about last Christmas that the prisoner brought it to me, I think it was yellow silveret, two remnants, I bought it of her, and paid Mr. Jones for it in his own shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you send her with them remnants?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Last year I sold a parcel of remnants as is usual at times in our shop; perhaps there might be such a thing as that, I cannot contradict that, for I gave the prisoner a gown myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mrs. Blackiter paying of you.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe she did, but I cannot remember it; I never trusted the prisoner to sell any thing to my knowledge on my own acount.</p>

            ; I had a bit of bread and butter in my hand, and I did not drink any; after that the other two women came down stairs and left the prisoner and prosecutor together a considerable time; after that she knock'd with the heel of her shoe; I went up to ask what she wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Smith. This was a little after 12 o'clock; she said she had got his watch, and wanted me to go with her to pawn it. I said I would not; he lay on the bed, whether he was asleep I know not, his lips did not move, he seem'd as if asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room was she in?</p>
               <p>C. Smith. She was on the bed at the time; I did not see any buckles she had, she had the watch in her hand; she staid up stairs some time, and then she came down, and was backwards and forwards in the lane after that, and was sadly in liquor about five in the morning, and went into her own apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch afterwards?</p>
               <p>C. Smith. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear the same as now before the justice?</p>

             went up to one of them, and collar'd him, and pretended to press him, the Venetian had a stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. I was not so near as to hear the words; the Venetian held his stick up out of Dempsey's reach, because Dempsey should not get it out of his hand; Dempsey turn'd round with his face towards the Blue Anchor, and cry'd, D - n your eyes, will no body bring us no sticks; upon that 14 or 15 sailors all ran up in a body, and presently I saw sticks enough fighting one among another; the Venetian men resented their blows when they were beat, and they fought again; I saw the Venetian man afterwards run under Mr. Parry's arm, he had no stick in his hand then, Mr. Parry was leaning against his own door at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a stick was it you saw in his hand when he held it up?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. It was a sort of a broomstick; the Venetian ran past me to get into Mr. Parry's house, and throw'd me down, and he was got out of sight in Mr. Parry's passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Parry any weapon in his hand?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. No, he had no stick, nor offer'd to strike; all I heard him say was, don't come here, I'll have no mob about my door. I saw Dempsey strike him a blow on the side of his head, a very hard blow; I saw the blood run, and somebody came and took him under his arms, and carry'd him into his room, which had been his tap room, when he kept a public house, there was blood fell at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to Dempsey?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. No, I did not, but turn'd to my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Donivan do any thing?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. No, I did not; he was in company with them, but I did not see him strike any.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Mr. Parry for health before?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. He was in very good health before this.</p>
               <p>Q. How old might be he?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. About 60, or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live afterwards?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. I cannot say how long, whether seven or eight days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wound afterwards?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. No, I never saw the wound at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the Venetians going along?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. One of them was going by the side of the other, talking their own language, they did not trouble their heads with any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of Donivan?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. I did not see what became of him, they were all gone in a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Venetians were there at this time?</p>
               <p>M. Putenham. I saw then but two, I saw more afterwards,</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other Venetians that came, come before or after Mr. Parry had receiv'd his hurt?</p>

            . Dempsey came up to my door after a foreigner, and laid hold on him by the left arm, and from under the foreigners coat he took a piece of wood, with four nails in it. The sailors had had some trifling words together, that morning, the English sailors touch'd the foreigners coats, I had seen them there several times before the thing happened, (she shews by a broomstick the length of the stick with four nails in it, to be about two feet and half long) the foreigners can't speak English, and our sailors by lifting the lappets of their cloths up, I took to be done in a sort of an affront to the foreigners.</p>
               <p>Q. What had they done to the English?</p>
               <p>M. Otway. I don't know that they did any thing to them, but I saw Dempsey lift up their coats four separate times, in a way of making game of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>M. Otway. This was about 9 or 10 in the morning, and between 11 and 12 came up one single man, just at the threshold of my door; then Dempsey came up and laid hold of his arm, and lifted up his coat, and from under it took out that stick with four nails in it. I said, Sir, do not go to strike with that stick, because it may be very prejudicial, there is nails in it; and he d - d me, and struck me a blow on my stomach, and I fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner strike the deceased?</p>
               <p>M. Otway. I can't say I saw Mr. Parry receive the blow, I was rendered senseless for some minutes, the people help'd me up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Parry?</p>
               <p>M. Otway. I did, he was standing leaning with his hand upon the inside of his own door.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he for health at that time?</p>
               <p>M. Otway. He was in perfect health.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any weapon in his hand at that time?</p>
               <p>M. Otway. No, he had not, he was a peaceable man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he received the blow did you see him?</p>
               <p>M. Otway. I saw him within a quarter of an hour after, he was all over blood, and from the place where he stood at the door to the chair,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100015"/> where he was sitting, was all blood, like as if a pig had been stuck; on the left side of the head were four holes, I saw them dress'd, he seemed to me as if he was in great agony.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he die?</p>
               <p>M. Otway. This was on monday the 21st of July, and he died the 2d of the following month.</p>
               <p>Q. from Dempsey. Whether the English sailors or the outlandish sailors began the quarrel?</p>
               <p>M. Otway. The outlandish sailors were going along very quietly, till Dempsey began with them several times before that day.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Fulbrook. I saw Dempsey begin with the foreigners first, I saw him knock one of them down.</p>
               <p>Q. How many foreigners were there?</p>
               <p>E. Fulbrook. There were six or seven of them in company. Dempsey ran up to the last witness's house, and knock'd an outlandish man down with his fist.</p>
               <p>Q. What had the outlandish man done to him?</p>
               <p>E. Fulbrook. He had said nothing to him, they were walking along very quiet; I saw a stick in Dempsey's hand soon after, but I saw nothing in his hand at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in the outlandish man's hand?</p>
               <p>E. Fulbrook. No, I did not see any thing in his hand; I saw Donivan with a stick in his hand, that he had taken out of Dempsey's hand, it was a square stick, with four nails at the end of it. I saw Dempsey strike several of the outlandish men, and I saw several of the outlandish men strive to run away from the two prisoners. Donivan pursued one of them; I saw one of them run into Mr. Parry's house, and Dempsey pursued him; the Venetian ran under Mr. Parry's arm into his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Parry a stick in his hand?</p>
               <p>E. Fulbrook. No, he had nothing in his hand, he stood leaning against his door, and said, he would have no words in his house, he sold no. liquors, and he would have no noise in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Parry for health?</p>
               <p>E. Fulbrook. He was very well in health.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Dempsey strike Parry?</p>
               <p>E. Fulbrook. No, I did not, I was stooping to take up a gregoe.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that?</p>
               <p>E. Fulbrook. That is a sort of a great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body near Parry besides Dempsey at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Fulbrook. No, no one was near him besides Dempsey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Parry afterwards?</p>
               <p>E. Fulbrook. I did. I believe it was within about a quarter of an hour after.</p>

            . On monday the 21st of July a messenger came for me in great haste to come to Mr. Parry, saying he was knock'd down and murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Hosford. This was in the forenoon. I went and found a very large wound; the wound extended cross the left side of the head, he had lost a deal of blood, the wound was about three or four inches long; an angular part separated from the cranium; I examin'd it to see if I could perceive a fracture, but I found none; I took notice at that time he did not complain of any pain, he was quite numbed all over his head; from that monday to friday I found no bad symptoms except that numbness; then a messenger came to me in a great hurry, and told me Mr. Parry had fell down in a fit: when I came, I perceiv'd he had an apoplectic fit; they had convey'd him to bed; that fit was succeeded with a universal tremor all over him, both his arms were paralitick, and a numbness and lethargy attended it; he died on the saturday was se'nnight after the wound was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you think his death was owing to the blow he received on his head?</p>
               <p>Hosford. I apprehended, that that numbness and universal tremor to be from the concussion of the blow; he was trepan'd afterwards; there was a great quantity of extravers'd blood that lay upon the brain, that came out as soon as the piece of bone was extracted, which was occasioned by some external force.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon what appeared upon opening his head, that this man died from that cause?</p>
               <p>Hosford. I have no doubt at all.</p>

               <p>I did not begin the quarrel, I was struck by one of the outlandish men, all the rest of the men ran away, and I staid to take him up for it. I went to Mr. Parry's house two days after, as they told me I was accus'd with it; I ask'd him if I was the man that struck him; they said the man that struck him was taller than I was, please to call Mr. Wisley.</p>

When he was gone, I told the man of it, and order'd him to go and bring him back; he went, and came back again, and told me he had overtaken him, but he had ran away from him, instead of coming with him to me; when my husband came home I told him of the affair; he went to my Lord Mayor and got a warrant; this was on the saturday, and on the sunday he came in the afternoon, and asked my husband to forgive him; my husband told him he would not. The prisoner said he never did such a thing before; he own'd he had taken the cups and saucers, and said he would give my husband half a guinea, if he would not expose him: we executed the warrant, and took him to the poultry counter.</p>

               <p>Friend. Seven weeks ago last Friday; I left nobody in the room but the prisoner at the bar; he very much importuned me to go and fetch him a pint of beer, and while I was gone, he was gone and my coat also.</p>

            . I am serjeant in the same company with the prisoner; the prosecutor came to me on the 19th of July, in the morning, and told me he had been robbed of his coat and things by the prisoner; I told him the prisoner had lain out of the barracks all night; the prosecutor described the coat: in about half an hour's time the prisoner came, and I confined him; after which I saw him take and throw the gloves into the hole as he was coming out (produc'd in court, and depos'd to) then I took a candle and looked about, and I saw this handkerchief, (produced, and deposed to) I charged the prisoner with the coat, he denied it; Mr. Friend said he should be contented to have him tried by a court marshal; but the court would not try him; he having been punished several times for such crimes before; then the colonel gave me a shilling to go and get a warrant from Mr. Fielding, and gave him up to the law.</p>

               <p>Lowther. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Lowther. I do.</p>
               <p>Counsel. It is proper the court should be informed what past two days before the fact was committed; you will please to give an account of what you know; the murder was committed on the 15th of August, begin on the 13th.</p>
               <p>Lowther. On wednesday the 13th of August Mr. Mathews came to me, and told me, Mr. Stirn had behaved so ill, he could no longer keep him in his house; and told me, he hop'd I would be kind enough to do what I could in order to his getting rid of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived with him?</p>
               <p>Lowther. He had lived with him about 2 months; I went with Mr. Mathews to justice Welch; the justice ask'd Mr. Mathews, whether there was any private contract between him and Mr. Stirn; or whether he was a lodger; Mr. Mathews told him he was no lodger, that there was no private contract or agreement, he was only upon sufferance in his house, so long as he thought proper; to which justice Welch told him, he had a right to turn him out, if he pleased, without giving him any timely notice; and desired he would be cautious, as Mr. Crawford had been with him before to tell him there had been some disputes between him and Mr. Stirn; then he desired him to get a couple of friends in his house; and when Mr. Stirn came in, to tell him that was his house, and desired he would walk out; and if he would not, to take him by the arm and desire him to go out. Mr. Mathews said he was a desperate man; that if he offered to do it, he would stick him; upon that, he advised him to take a peace officer with him; upon this Mr. Mathews got a constable and two friends; I happened to be one of them; we sat at Mr. Mathews's I believe two hours, between 10 and 11; Mr. Stirn knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Lowther. This was on wednesday August the 13th at night; I opened the door for him; he came in; he saw his goods that were in Mr. Mathews's house were brought out of the room where he lay, and were in the passage; as Mr. Stirn came into the house, he ask'd who was it that has done this, (meaning the carrying his goods into the passage) he seemed to be angry. Mr. Mathews told him he had done it, and he insisted on his leaving his house, and said, you have told me you will not leave my house without you leave it by force, and now I am determined that you shall go. Mr. Stirn told him he was a bad man, and a coward, and he durst not turn him out of his house without having assistance (meaning the company present) Mr. Mathews desired him to take a glass of wine; and said, let us part friendly. Mr. Stirn said, he would not go till he had plaid his last tune; there was a harpsicord in the room, and he went and struck it five or six times; then he said I want but half a guinea, and you may do what you will with my goods (books and things) Mr. Mathews said, if he will tell him what he wanted half a guinea for, if he had not so much in his pocket, he would give him, or lend him, half a guinea. Mr. Strin put his hand in his pocket (what money he had I do not know) he said, no, I have money enough, as much as I want. I have spoke with a man to day that will write my life and your's (that was to Mr. Mathews) Mr. Mathews desired him to take care what he said, for he had already said enough for him to lay him by the heels. Mr. Stirn said, what have I said. Mr. Mathews said, that he said Crawford (meaning Mr. Crawford) might thank his God that he had got rid of him in the manner he had done, but that you would have your revenge on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he lived with Mr. Crawford before that?</p>
               <p>Lowther. He had, - Upon this Mr. Stirn desired Mr. Mathews would give him his hand. Mr. Mathews held out his hand, and Mr. Stirn grasp'd it in both his hands, and said, I have said so, and here is my hand I will have my revenge on you; after a good deal of oppobrious language between them, Mr. Stirn walk'd out of the house along with the constable,</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean in the custody of the constable?</p>
               <p>Lowther. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100020"/>Q. Was the constable present the whole time these words past?</p>
               <p>Lowther. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Lowther. His name is Spence.</p>
               <p>Counsel. The attorney says he never heard of this fact before, so he is not on the back of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this all that past that evening?</p>
               <p>Lowther. This is all, there is nothing that past the next day that I know of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then come to the 15th.</p>
               <p>Lowther. On friday evening the 15th of August, about the hour of 10 in the evening, I happened accidentally to go in at Mr. Pew's, the Pewter Platter, a public house, in Cross street, Hatton garden, there I found Mr. Chapman and Mr. Mathews together; there were more people in the room, but none joining in company but themselves. I sat down, and joined in company with them. In a few minutes Mr. Stirn came into the room, and sat down at the same table. Mr. Chapman the surgeon call'd Mr. Stirn out, or sent for him out, I don't know which, what past between them I cannot say. Mr. Crawford came in, and sat down with us. Mr. Stirn came in again by himself in a few minutes. Mr. Chapman went away. Mr. Stirn walk'd about the room by himself; he apply'd to Mr. Mathews, and said, you have accus'd me with theft and adultery. Mr. Mathews told him, he had not accus'd him of either, nor did he believe he was guilty of either; but if he had not had a greater dependence on his wife's virtue than his honour, he did not know what might be the consequence. Mr. Stirn told Mr. Mathews he was never pox'd in his life; Mr. Mathews said, nor I either; he added, you are a dirty fellow, and you ought to be sent to your own lowsy country, or words to that purpose. Mr. Stirn walk'd about the room a few minutes, and then pull'd a small piece of paper out of his pocket, and held it in his hand, with a seeming desire that Mr. Mathews should take notice of it, and afterwards burnt it in the candle. He walk'd about the room for a few minutes; then Mr. Crawford took notice, that he look'd very fiery; and he desir'd me and Mr. Mathews, that we would for heaven's sake drink his health. I drank his health immediately, and to the best of my remembrance so did Mr. Mathews. Stirn still walk'd about the room for a few minutes, and then came and stood at Mr. Crawford's elbow; then he came and stood by me, for the value of a minute, or a minute and a half; I observ'd him to stretch his hand cross me, with what I then thought a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mr. Mathews then?</p>
               <p>Lowther. He was then sitting next to me at my elbow. I observed, as I said before, a piece of paper, as I thought; instantly upon its passing me, I observ'd a flash, and report of powder. Mr. Mathews gave a kind of a spring, and fell forwards; died, and never spoke or groan'd; instantly, upon his falling. I heard a report of more powder, what I could not conceive at that time. I look'd about me, and saw Mr. Stirn stand in amaze, and immediately drew towards the door, as I apprehended to get away; upon which he was laid hold on by Mr. Warford, and pull'd to the ground. I immediately came up to him; he said, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, for I shall be hang'd. I told him Mr. Mathews was dead; he said, he was not sorry, but was sorry he had not shot himself.</p>
               <p>Q. to prisoner. If you please to ask this witness any questions, or do you chuse to leave it to your counsel?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether Mr. Lowther did not call me a madman?</p>
               <p>Lowther. I did, and said Bedlam was the fittest place for him, according to his behaviour; we were to have gone into a private room, and to have no words, and for him to behave in this sort, occasioned me to say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the situation all the parties were in at that time.</p>
               <p>Lowther. Mr. Chapman, Mr. Mathews and I were together at the table; then Mr. Stirn came in, and Mr. Crawford came in after him. Mr. Chapman call'd Mr. Stirn out, he went away, Mr. Stirn came in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in the room at the time the pistol went off?</p>
               <p>Lowther. There were left myself, Mr. Mathews, Mr. Crawford, and the prisoner, and several others that did not belong to our company.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was you in?</p>

            . I was in the room at the Pewter Platter when this accident happened. I came into that room about half an hour after nine in the evening; I had not been there above half an hour before Mr. Mathews came in; there were three young gentleman there of my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did Mr. Mathews come in?</p>
               <p>Warford. He came in I believe about a quarter before 10, and Mr. Chapman with him; Mr. Mathews told me, they had been at Mr. Foote's; and he related the circumstances of what he had heard, and was extreamly pleased, and said, If you are dull go and hear Mr. Foote. Presently came in Mr. Stirn; Mr. Mathews sat with his back to the door, Mr. Stirn went round him, and sat down about 10 minutes by the fire place; then in came Mr. Crawford; immediately upon that Mr. Stirn got up, and went to Mr. Crawford, and they shook each other by the hand; Mr. Crawford is the gentleman that keeps the acadamy when Mr. Stirn lived; Stirn went then and stood at the back of Mr. Crawford's chair a considerable time; he came round after that, and stood at the back of my chair, I believe about 10 minutes; I thought he was gone out, but when I looked behind me, I was surprized to see him behind my chair; from thence he went to the back of Mr. Mathews, and lean'd on the back of a chair that a young man sat in next to Mr. Mathews, Mr. Cartwright's chair: he address'd himself to Mr. Mathews, and said, Sir, why did not you meet me (they are the words as near as I can remember) Mr. Mathews made answer, I had not an opportunity, I have been with Mr. Chapman - but I am here now (after a pause) upon that Mr. Crawford got up from his chair, and said, for God's sake, Mr. Stirn, I desire you will be quiet, moderate your passion, and said a good deal; he made answer, his honour was ruined, and his reputation; he had been turned out of the house like a villain and a scoundrel, and such like. Mr. Mathews made answer, Mr. Stirn, you had better be quiet, you will only expose yourself. Mr. Stirn made answer, he had been used very ill, he had been used like a scoundrel and a villain. Mr. Mathews said, instead of your being used very ill, you have used me very ill; you ran up and down stairs after my wife, and in the kitchen, and the reason you gave for it was this, that I was jealous of you, and you would give me reason to be jealous. Upon which Mr. Stirn reply'd, no, it was not so;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100023"/> indeed his wife had taken him by the hand, and had desired him to go down into the kitchen with her. Upon which one of the company said, I suppose not with any bad intention; no said Stirn, it could not be so, there were 2 of the maids in the kitchen, it was only to keep her company while she was ironing Mr. Mathews said to him, you will not say so to my wife's face, or the maid's; he said, yes, he would; and you yourself did call your wife whore. Then I took him up and said, I wonder you should mention such a thing in public company. I think it is very base Mr. Crawford wink'd at me; then I desisted; then Mr. Stirn said, I never had the pox. Mr. Mathews said, you are a scoundrel, and ought to be sent into your lowsey country; I believe Mr. Stirn was in the house 3 quarters of an hour; presently after that I saw the flash, which I afterwards found to be a pistol; I heard the report of a couple of pistols, I cannot preread to say I saw 2 flashes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe after this?</p>
               <p>Warford. Immediately upon this the company was put into confusion; as to me, I could not believe my senses, till by and by I saw him attempt to run to the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any body dead in the room before that?</p>
               <p>Warford. I saw Mr. Mathews seem as if he was shot, but it was so sudden, I could not pretend to say he was dead or not: I got up in a great passion, and ran after the prisoner towards the door, catch'd him by the collar, and stung him all along upon the ground, and had him on the ground between my legs. He desired I would kill him, I said no, you villain, I will not do you so great a benefit, you will be hanged. He was secured, and taken to Bridewell that night. I had some discourse, with him going there; I asked him how he could be guilty of such a crime to a man that had been his best friend in England. He said, his brother told him 3 years ago, he was afraid he would come to some unhappy end.</p>

               <p>Q. What other persons were in the room at the time?</p>
               <p>Warford. Mr. Ashurst and Mr. Cartwright were there.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Lowther in the room during this conversation?</p>
               <p>Warford. He was, the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of you round the table?</p>
               <p>Warford. There were 10 people round the table besides the deceased; I know the names of all of them except one, who was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember you, or any of the company, telling the prisoner he was mad, and ought to be confined in Bedlam?</p>
               <p>Warford. I believe it was said so. Mr. Crawford endeavoured to make him quiet, but could not. I think somebody made use of that expres-sion.</p>

            . I was in the room when this accident happen'd. I went there between 8 and 9 in company with Mr. Cartwright; I had been there about an hour when Mr. Mathews came in; soon after that I observ'd Mr. Stirn sitting in a chair; I did not see him come in; after about 10 minutes he got up, and walk'd back wards and forwards, and afterwards he came and leaned on Mr. Cartwright's chair, that sat next to me, and said, Mr. Mathews you have us'd me as an adulterer and a thief. Mr. Mathews desir'd him not to expose himself in public company, but sit down and be quiet; I did not take particular notice what past after; I heard the report of 2 pistols.</p>

               <p>Ashurst. I did not see him till about 5 minutes after, the smoke was in my face; I saw Mr. Mathews about a minute after the report make a motion, and brought out some blood. I ask'd Mr. Stirn how he could do such a violent action; he said, he did intend to shoot himself as well as him (meaning Mr. Mathews) as I imagine.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100024"/>

I was next to the deceased when this happened; I heard the report of two pistols, but was looking another way, so cannot tell who fired the pistols; I heard Mr. Stirn say about 3 minutes afterwards, he wish'd he had shot himself; he did not care that he had shot Mr. Mathews, so that he had but shot himself.</p>

               <p>Cuttey. Yes, my shop-mate did, I was by at the time the gentleman desired they might be loaded, and I loaded one, and my shop-mate the other.</p>

               <p>Cuttey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they bought near that time?</p>
               <p>Cuttey. They were bought about 3 or 4 days before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bought them?</p>

I went there, and saw Mr. Mathews lying dead in a corner of the room, there were many people there; I asked if they had secured the person that did it; they said he was in the midst of the people, pointing to Mr. Stirn; I asked him if he was the person that murdered Mr. Mathews; he said yes, Sir, I shot him myself, and no body else; I desired the people to take notice that he confess'd the fact; somebody reply'd, there was no occasion to be so particular, as there were so many people in the room that saw him do it; I asked him what could induce him to commit so horrid a crime; he said, his honour was wounded by Mr. Mathews, which was dearer to him than his life; and that he was only sorry he had not shot himself.</p>

            , I am a surgeon; I had been to the play with Mr. Mathews, I came with him to the Pewter Platter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when the accident happened?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I was not; I was sent for after Mr. Mathews was killed to come to see him, to see if there was any thing that I could do as a surgeon for him; I found him quite dead.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Chapman. It was a wound made by a pistol-ball, as appear'd to me on the left side of the breast-bone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the wound?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I did, before the coroner? I traced it about 6 inches into the body.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Chapman. That was the next day; but I saw it immediately when I came that night; I had no doubt of it then, but that was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you extract the ball?</p>
               <p>Chapman. No, I did not, I did not attempt that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel the ball with your instrument?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I did not, but it appeared by the wound to be given by a ball.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the deceased for health that day you were at the Pewter Platter together?</p>
               <p>Chapman. The deceased was in very good health, and very chearful.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Stirn?</p>
               <p>Chapman. About a year and half, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been well acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Chapman. Very intimate, he has been often at my house and drank tea, and we have drank together in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any signs of insanity by him?</p>
               <p>Chapman. Sometimes his behaviour has been very extraordinary, that I could not account for.</p>
               <p>Counsel. In what, give an account.</p>
               <p>Chapman. He us'd to entertain suspicion against Mr. Crawford, very strange suspicions, that I could not account for; when I have talk'd upon that subject, he talked as I thought very unreasonable; but at other times he talked like a man of sense and education.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you mention any particular instance?</p>
               <p>Chapman. A little before Christmas last, Mr. Crawford and he had a difference, and upon that occasion they both of them us'd to call upon me, and tell what had past between them; one story Mr. Crawford told me, was so very strange, that at that time I believe I did say (he must be mad) or some such words.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of the prisoner ever making an attempt upon himself before this?</p>
               <p>Chapman. He once said he had a design of shooting himself, and he escaped by a very extraordinary accident; he was loading a pistol for that purpose, and the ball was too big to go down with ease, and in endeavouring to push the ball down, he broke the rammer, and his expression was, he thank'd God, what a precipice he had escap'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon that as an act of lunacy?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I rather looked upon it as an act of despair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he proceed thus for a day or two together, or only momentary?</p>
               <p>Chapman. Only momentary before me.</p>
               <p>Q. As to your opinion, whether there are not such cases of lunacy, where the lunaftic shall speak<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100026"/> very reasonable and sensible, and shall be depriv'd of his reason some small time by sits?</p>
               <p>Chapman. That has not fallen immediately in my way to consider of; I believe that is the case very often with mad people, that they have intervals, and those sometimes of very long duration; and it may happen, that the sits may be very short, I apprehend, and such, that the person may be deprived of reason, I believe, but I have not been conversant with these disorders; I thought Mr. Stirn was in despair, and endeavour'd to remove his despair, as much as I could, but I cannot take upon me to say I actually thought him mad.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he was curable by medicine of this slighty madness?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do thou think he was mad enough to be put into Bedlam?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I believe not; I never heard of any, but as they have been represented by Mr. Crawford; I cannot give it as my absolute opinion that he was a madman.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your own particular knowledge what is your opinion?</p>
               <p>Chapman. Upon my own knowledge, I don't think him a mad man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he could commit a murder, and not know what he was doing at that time?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you call him out of the room for?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I call'd him out to give him some advice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then appear to be out of his senses?</p>
               <p>Chapman. He appear'd to b e strangely agitated, but I can't pretend to say that it was madness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chapman was always intimate with me and Mr. Crawford; he has frequently said to Mr. Crawford, that the man was to be pitied; if he was a fool, yet he might be an honest man; those were his speeches to Mr. Crawford, but now he seems to have forgot them. I insist upon it, that I have been distracted with the affront that Mr. Mathews has given me, that for 2 days I did not utter two sentences, and was not in my senses; I was oblig'd to lie all night in the bed in a high-fever, and quite distracted, and was asham'd to look into any body's face; for I thought, if they saw me, they would see it in me.</p>

            . I have been acquainted with the prisoner since the month of June 1758, a little after he came into England.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, during that course of time, that you have seen any symptoms of Lunacy by him; and if you have, give your reasons to the Court.</p>
               <p>Crawford. Sir. Mr. Stirn. in his cool moments, was a person of so much good sense, and apparently with that good sense so very religious and virtuous, that every one that became acquainted with him were atracted with him, and esteemed him; yet notwithstanding this good sense and excellent appearances, he has fallen out into such extravagancies, that I never could account for upon any other principle, than supporting him insane; for notwithstanding he was dessitate of friends, and in a strange country, dependent wholly upon me and my favour, he has frequently, upon intimation of his honour-being mentioned, started to such a degree of sury, that I have been frequently surprized; when my friends have come to see me; he has ey'd them all with such a countenance, that they have intimated to me he was certainly mad. The minister of the German chapel in the Savoy, he has frequently said to me, this unhappy man is indeed mad, and I would have you get him shaved and bleeded every month, if possible. Mr. Stirn, notwithstanding my kindness, and protestations of kindness to him, us'd to intimate, that I and my wife, and servants, have at different times attempted to take away his life, by mixing poison in his tea, and other liquors; and he has frequently examin'd it. He has sometimes enter'd into a friendly conversation, and express'd the greatest sense and good nature; sometimes he would take my hand in his hand, and with an extasy say, Sir, you are my best friend in the world you have been my great benefactor and friend; he has instantly turn'd and said, I was a great villain, and had some great design upon him. I have gone in the fields with him sometimes, and he has behav'd in this extraordinary manner. I have communicated this to my friends, and to the unhappy victim that is dead, and frequently persuaded him from taking him into his house, telling him, that he was of that extraordinary turn of mind, that would give him such disturbance that would ruin his peace. I always imputed it to a degree of insanity; it was the sense<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100027"/> of my wife, it was the sense of my sister, who us'd to say, for God's sake my dear, endeavour to get rid of Mr. Stirn, he will be that the death of you; and my sister has said, that at the change of the moon, and spring and fall, he was remarkably agitated, and stirred up. I remembered I was in his company one evening, he enter'd upon a subject, upon the properest method to be made use of in instructing of youth. I mentioned moderation and forbearance to children of bad capacities; to which he paid some attention; he started up, looking upon me with great fury; my wife got up, and seem'd terrify'd at him; saying, pray Sir go to bed; I standing up said, pray Sir go to bed; he raised the candlestick, and made several attempts at my head with it, which I defended with my left arm; I then pull'd him down to the ground; he then appeared in a dreadful fury; denouncing great fury; he went to bed, and the next morning he appeared as remarkable humbled, and would frequently say my dear Sir, I am hurried away by a force which I cannot repel, I am made the port of passion, and my distresses are exquisite on the consideration of it; these are the several reasons that I have for his insanity.</p>

               <p>Q. Give the court an account of him at the time this affair happened at the Pewter Platter.</p>
               <p>Crawford. My opinion that I form'd of him was, that he had some design upon himself, I imagined that he would destroy himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear he had such a design before?</p>
               <p>Crawford. I have heard he had, from a relation of Mr. Chapman, and he kept a naked sword in his room, and upon my crossing the passage he has started up, and put himself upon his guard, on an apprehension that I should kill him, or send somebody else to do it, as I was his best friend, and he depended upon me, and all my endeavours were to serve and benefit him; I thought his actions were unreasonable, and I imputed it to a kind of insanity that was not in his power to prevent.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing what past on the 15th of August last in the evening?</p>
               <p>Crawford. I believe it is necessary to begin at the 13th of last month. In the afternoon he came to my house, my wife told me he had been there; she said, my dear, I have seen Mr. Stirn, he looks frightfully, take care of him. When he came in he behaved with great coolness and moderation, I ask'd him to sit down; he ask'd me a question, and said, have you been at Mr. Welch's, and said any thing against me; I told him, Sir, upon the affair of the candlestick, I told him something respecting you, that gave great room for suspicion. I went in order to find out some method to get rid of him. My complaint to him was, that he at different times had behav'd in a turbulent manner, that I could not account for, that he entertain'd strange suspicions of me and my family, diametrically opposite to truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. What did you propose or desire Mr. Welch to do?</p>
               <p>Crawford. I desir'd him to grant me a warrant to take him out of my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Did you tell Mr. Welch you considered him as a breaker of the peace, or that he might be taken care of as a madman?</p>
               <p>Crawford. No, I don't recollect I said any such thing, of his being a madman. I desir'd a warrant of Mr. Welch.</p>
               <p>Recorder. Did Mr. Welch grant you a warrant?</p>
               <p>Crawford. He did, when I got that I came home, and upon my coming home, I thought I would not serve the warrant, least I should deprive this unhappy youth'd of every way of subsisting; and I went to Mr. Mathews with the warrant in my hand, as Mr. Mathews had frequently entertained him in his house, and prosessed a friendship for him, notwithstanding my frequently desiring him not; I told him the behaviour of Mr. Stirn, telling him I had a warrant in my hand, and desired him as his friend to endeavour to persuade him to go peaceably cut of my house; he said he would not interfere in it at all; after that Mr. Stirn, upon some confession to me of sorrow for what he had done, I proposed he should continue with me in his business; but I would have him by all means quit my house, as my wife had been frequently terrified by him; he quitted my house the 25th or 26th of June last, and went to Mr. Mathews's: when Mr. Stirn came to my house and asked me this question, I said Mr. Welch had mistaken me in my relation; I said I did not intimate to him that he had been guilty of what had been laid to his charge, but Mr. Welch had mistaken me; (but this story has no relation to the matter of fact, so I need not mention it) I speak this least the character of justice Welch should be impeached, whole honour and good nature was very manifest in what he did; Mr. Stirn in my house spoke pretty loud; this was about the 19th; I said, pray do not speak loud, it is not a proper place to speak these matters in (he was speaking of Mr. Mathews) go to a coffee-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100028"/> said I, and I will come to you; he went out to Bartlet's buildings coffee-house; I and he went into a room together, in which room he recapitulated several particulars between him and Mr. Mathews; telling me Mr. Mathews had charged him with a most grievous violent crime.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. How can you apply this to evidence of insanity; here he gives you an account of all the disputes between him and Mr. Mathews, and now you would make this man quite a madman.</p>
               <p>Crawford. I am under a necessity to speak all these matters, as he recapitulated some things upon my expostulating with him upon the necessity of pacifying Mr. Mathews, whom I had believed to have been jealous of him; upon my saying to him, Sir, whether these stories are well or ill founded, you ought to go to Mr. Mathews, and endeavour to reconcile him to his wife, least the consequence should be eternally unhappy; Mr. Stirn arose up and said, if I speak another word, he would - be would - in a great passion; said he, I shall suspect you and Mr. Mathews, together with Mr. Chapman, have laid a scheme in order to destroy and ruin my character; I called upon him to consider my past conduct to him, by endeavouring to bring about a reconciliation; he went from me in a strange kind of a disposition, as I thought, with suspicions of me; the next evening he came to my house with Mr. Chapman, he seemed to be under great perturbation of mind; we went into the fields to take a walk, he, Mr. Chapman, and I; I was endeavouring to get him to reconcile himself under those difficulties, under those of Mr. Mathews's putting him out of his house; he expressed many suspicions of me; saying, he did not believe I was his friend; on the bowling-green Mr. Taylor, the occulist, whom we met with, said, what was the matter with this man; presently I met Mrs. Taylor, she asked what was the matter; I said, indeed madam, he is certainly out of his senses; this was on the Thursday: on the Friday he came and dined at my house; after dinner he started up, and with a great appearance of wildness stared round him, uttering several invectives against the deceased; saying, he had wounded him in such a manner, he could not live under the crimes he had charged him with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Did you observe his behaviour on the evening, at the very time of this affair?</p>
               <p>Crawford. That afternoon Mr. Stirn overtook me in Hatton Garden; seeing him in a strange disposition, I laid hold of his hand, and said, pray go along with me; he said he was going to see Mr. Chapman; I said he was not at home; I intreat you come along with me, several times pulling him by the hand; he came along with me, he entered into discourse respecting Mr. Mathews, and seemed to entertain those suspicions respecting me, in endeavouring to dishonour and bring him to disgrace; as we were going into the fields, I observed him look in a frightful manner, I said Mr. Stirn you have some bad design.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Crawford. This was on Friday evening between 6 and 7 o'clock; he said, why so, why so; I saw fury and despondency fixed upon his countenance, I said I conceived that design to be upon himself; he started back and said, what makes you think so; then I replied, from his appearance; then he wanted to go away from me: I had an inclination to keep him along with me, in order to dispose him to a peaceable disposition; as I took him by the hand he started back, and looked at me from head to foot; I laid hold of him, and forced him to the White Conduit house, by Islington; when we came there, he said he would turn round; I still followed him, and said, my dear Sir, do not suffer the enemy to get the better of you; you are hurried away by some dreadful enemy, by endeavouring to bring you to destruction; he put his hand to his breast, and said, O Sir, I am abandoned by my God, I am lost in my character, and cannot live; and then burst into a flood of tears; I could not prevail upon him to go with me any farther, and then I parted from him; I went then to Islington, to the Angel, and told a gentleman there, that I had just parted with an unhappy youth, that I feared was in a despairing state; I quitted that company, and in the evening went to find Mr. Stirn, and found him at Owen's coffee-house, on the south side of Holbourn; whether he thought I had discovered any of his intentions or no, I cannot say; he changed in his countenance, and looked extremely passive; he said, now how do I look; I said you look very well; presently after he said he expected Mr. Mathews; I said he will certainly not come where you are; then he said he would go to Mr. Pew's, at the Pewter Platter; I endeavoured to persuade him to go to his lodgings, he paid no regard to that; upon my going to my house, and hearing Mr. Chapman was at Mr. Pew's, I imagined Mr. Mathews, Mr. Lowther,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100029"/> and the rest were there, in order to accommodate matters; I came in there, Mr. Stirn sat at the upper end of the room, looking desperately fierce; he got up and came to me, on the left hand side of Mr. Chapman, who sat at the left hand of Mr. Lowther, that was also on the left hand of Mr. Mathews; when he came round, I took him by the hand and squeezed it (as much as to say be peaceable) he drew his hand from me, and looked desperately wild; Mr. Chapman beckoned to him to follow him out at the door; Mr. Stirn seemed to pay no regard to him; I leaned over the chair and said, pray go; he went to Mr. Chapman; while he was out at the door I whispered Mr. Mathews, and said, pray Sir, let me speak one word in behalf of the unhappy youth; pray Sir, I intreat you to drink his health; consider his infirmity; Mr. Mathews said he would; but upon Mr. Stirn's coming in, and some words passing, which were very aggravating, and Mr. Mathews repeating some circumstances as his resentment was stirred up; he called him scoundrel, and said he should go home to his lousy country, or countrymen; and the rest of the company cried out, you are mad, you are mad, and ought to be confined in Bedlam; Mr. Stirn stood at my shoulder; there was a vacant chair betwixt me and Mr. Lowther, over which I believe he held his hand; Mr. Mathews expressing himself in these words; Mr. Stirn came, and I made way for him to fit down, thinking he was something easy; he was no sooner come, but I heard the explosion of 2 pistols; one of them finished the life of Mr. Mathews, and the other aimed at himself; after that I was so moved at the scene, that I quitted the room, and came back presently, and asked if Mr. Mathews was dead, and saw him lying over the lap of some gentleman, whom I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. That is to me a dark expression; when I compare it with part of your evidence, where you propose a reconciliation between Mr. Mathews and a real madman, because you consider this man as a real madman.</p>
               <p>Crawford. I never expected it would have been of a lasting duration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Was this expression he made use of (that his honour was wounded, he was represented as a thief and an adulterer) is that like an expression of a madman?</p>
               <p>Crawford. I must confess I have heard and read of people under the infirmity of madness, that are at different times extremely sensible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Here is a man goes into a room where you are all in company, with a couple of pistols, covered and disguis'd in papers, and then commits this fact, is that a sign of a madman; I want to know upon what principles you form your opinion?</p>
               <p>Crawford. To make a reply to you, would be a kind of presumption.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Did not he behave in that regular uniform way in meeting Mr. Mathews, as any other man would have done?</p>
               <p>Crawford. Yes, it had all that apprearance, but I must confess madmen may frequently have a design with a great degree of forethought and malice - this was only my opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Did he know where he went, and answer all appointments?</p>
               <p>Crawford. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. You did not complain to Mr. Welch that he was a madman?</p>
               <p>Crawford. I did say to Mr. Welch he had some unaccountable behaviour.</p>
               <p>Counsel for prisoner to Mr. Chapman. You gave an account of the information you had received from Mr. Crawford, that you at that time had formed an opinion that he was at that time had formed an opinion that he was not in his right mind, that he was at times out of his senses.</p>
               <p>Chapman. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Whether the facts that you were acquainted with by Mr. Crawford were the same facts that he has related in court?</p>
               <p>Chapman. In general they are, but they are not so circumstantially related.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Are you now of the same opinion that you was at the same time that you gave Mr Crawford your opinion, supposing the case in the manner as Mr. Crawford has stated it?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I cannot form an opinion of madness from it, there certainly was something more striking in the story he told, than what he has now related.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. He has given an account that some of these slighty fits most frequently happened at full and change of the moon; is that a symptom that frequently happens to lunatic people.</p>
               <p>Chapman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Here is an event that has continued from the 13th to the 15th of August, at the t ime the misfortune happened; can you suppose from your acquaintance you had with him, and the observations you made from his behaviour, this could be madness that lasted from that time,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100030"/> to the time of the death of the deceased; or do you imagine from what you have heard and observed, that this was a continued malice, from the 13th to the evening of the 15th, do you think a madness continued so long as that?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I think not.</p>
               <p>Counsel for prisoners. Whether in that time there might not have been divers short fits of madness?</p>
               <p>Chapman. Yes.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Whether he might not repeat those acts of violence or madness, and yet in the intervals between he may be very cool and sober?</p>
               <p>Chapman. Yes.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Do you know any case of any mad people when they have been in their fits of madness, whether they have not in some particular things appeared to be reasonable?</p>
               <p>Chapman. It never once in my life-time fell to me to attend a madman.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Do not mad people act sometimes with great tunning to get out of the possession of their keepers?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I believe from what I have heard they will.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner to Crawford. Do you now recollect any thing that you have omitted?</p>
               <p>Crawford. One of the stories that Mr. Chapman alludes to was this; Mr. Stirn, walking in the fields one evening going along in friendly conversation, he in his, usual way started and star'd at me with a dreadful appearance, and said to me, you have certainly some ill design upon me; I frequently repeated to him, for God's sake hold your tongue; then he would say, I'll I'll I'll - and appear in dreadful agitation; there is another thing observable, and that is this; some people now present have heard Mr. and Mrs. Mathews say, they believed he was a person even out of his senses, and even a madman; Mr. Chapman can answer a question of that sort.</p>
               <p>Chapman. I never heard the deceased; but since this unhappy affair I have heard her say, that both she and Mr. Mathews thought he was certainly mad.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether Mr. Chapman, from my appearance, did not think I was melancholy mad.</p>
               <p>Chapman. I thought you was in a desponding way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder to Crawford. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Crawford. It is that of a schoolmaster.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. How long did the prisoner live with you?</p>
               <p>Crawford. He lived with me near two years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. During that time what was his imployment?</p>
               <p>Crawford. It was to assist in teaching the classics.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. How came you to suffer a man, that you took to be a madman, to continue so long with you in that imploy?</p>
               <p>Crawford. I did not look upon him to be a madman, but a periodical madness. I thought him in these fits, only when his honour was affected; I have heard there are many men mad, that at times are every way perfectly sensible.</p>

            . The young lad the prosecutor came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>J. Wilmot. I live in Long-ditch, Westminster; he knocked at the door, and asked if the constable was at home; I said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your husband a constable?</p>
               <p>J. Wilmot. Yes; he said can you tell me where another lives; saying, he was a stranger, and had nobody to take his part, and that he was robbed in the park, by a woman, and it was his master's money; I unhappily went with the lad up to the century box, there was a woman; I said to the century you must take care of this woman; then she put her hand out of the box, and said, I want to speak with you; said I, do you know good woman what you have done, you have done a thing that will hang you; she said, I know what I have done; said I, return the money, for if you are turned out, the mob will tare you to pieces; said she, I will return him 2 shillings; she took her money out of her apron, and returned him a shillings and 6 pence; then the corporal came up, and said, what is here; the century said, I have got a prisoner for a robbery; who is she, said he, then he looked into the box, and said, so you bitch is it you; he turned her out of the box, and away she and the boy went together, I know no more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the same woman?</p>
               <p>J. Wilmot. Indeed I do not know that it is the same.</p>

               <p>I am not the woman, I never did such a thing; indeed I never took anything from him.</p>

               <p>A. Clark. I found this gown (producing one) on the prisoner's back when I saw her in the compter; I heard she was in Woodstreet compter, so I went and found her there; she was committed for something else.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it made of?</p>
               <p>A. Clark. It is silk and stuff; the pawnbroker has the shift body, and two aprons; he is here.</p>

               <p>A. Clark. I found them about the beginning of August.</p>

               <p>A. Clark. I did not ask her, because I knew where she had it; she told me where the stockings were in pawn, and I went and fetched them, and paid a shilling and a penny.</p>

            . I am a watchman, I was order'd to take the prisoner and search him; I pull'd these three tea spoons from out of his left hand breeches pocket, and Mr. Bale said they were his spoons, by a private mark (produc'd in court)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are my spoons to the best of my knowledge, one spoon may be like another, but they are like my spoons, I miss'd 3 spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. to Newbury. What did the prosecutor charge the prisoner with?</p>
               <p>Newbury. He said he had a suspicion the prisoner had robb'd him of some silver spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how many?</p>
               <p>Newbury. I think he said three in the watch-house, and three were found; the prisoner seem'd very much in liquor, he seem'd quite stupify'd with liquor; we took him before an alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Newbury. He made little or no answer; all that I heard him say was, he said they were found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You mention you was very sorry he was going abroad.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, my lord. I am not a traitor to the government. (The spoons inspected by the court and the jury)</p>
               <p>Q. Here are letters mark'd on them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had mark'd them, in order to send them to the engraver to be engrav'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of July I was at work at the prosecutor's house. My corporal came to me in the afternoon; he ask'd me if I was willing to go abroad with the company; I told him I would, and left my work immediately; he and I went over the water, to give notice to others that had no more notice than I. It might be about seven at night when I came to Turnmill-street, at the Nag's head; there sat my master Bale; when I got my napsack, and every thing fit to go broad, he brought my napsack and firelock, and put my things in it; he ask'd me, if he could arrest me, that I should not go abroad. I said, I did not know; then he swore he would swear a robbery against me to save me. He bid me to take three of his tea spoons; I did; then we came to Field lane, and drank with some young fellows that were going abroad, there I fought a man, he held the tea spoons all the time; he brought a fork afterwards to mark these spoons, that he might swear to them; after that he went and got the watch, and took me in custody; after that he told me he would only put me in goal, he would not throw in a bill against me.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you propose to do this, in order to keep him from going abroad?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never propos'd any such thing.</p>

               <p>Woodman. A hat, a cap, and a furtout coat; there was a woman with him, she had the coat, but she deliver'd that to him before he dropp'd them, in order to run away; I took and secur'd her.</p>

Said the man of the house, there are some keys dropp'd under the table; the constable took them up, and said, these are picklock keys.</p>

            ; the man has been at sea some time, but I know it is the property of the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are you?</p>
               <p>Scott. I am a waiter, and serv'd my time to a vintner and cooper; I went into the woman's house with a pint of beer; she was gone out, and I was talking to the maid; I heard something give a crack in the room; I said there is somebody gone out of the house; the maid got up; and went into the room, and came and said, she did not see any body, but said the glass was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the house?</p>
               <p>Scott. No, I did not, I ran out, and there I saw the prisoner with the glass in his hand: I ran after him; and he throw'd it into a dry ditch, there I found it,</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prosecutor live?</p>
               <p>Scott. Betwixt St. James's Park and Chelsea, in the way to Ranelangh.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the house did you find it?</p>
               <p>Scott. I found it about 50 yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Scott. I live at Avery farm, about two doors from the woman's house, at the sign of the Royal Oak.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house does the woman keep?</p>
               <p>Scott. There is no name only a board wrote up, a coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the prisoner to be a man of credit and reputation?</p>
               <p>Scott. I do, I have heard he is so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he took it with an intent to steal it.</p>
               <p>Scott. I can't say he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mrs. Moit?</p>
               <p>Scott. She is at home very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she angry with you for stopping the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Scott. No, she was only angry, fearing trouble, she wanted no trouble at all, she is a very honest woman, I'll assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the woman desirous of having the prisoner discharg'd?</p>
               <p>Scott. She was very agreeable to it.</p>

               <p>Q. What door did your mother come to with the woman?</p>
               <p>Taylor. At the door where I lodg'd at Acton, just by the Black Lion, there is only a stable parts them; I said, I would go with the woman, I went a little way, and then my mother came after me, and said she would go; I went a little way, just up the hill, then I came back, and my mother went along with her.</p>

               <p>Taylor. No, I never saw her alive afterwards?</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I did not got to bed, there were two little children in the house, and I was with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your father come home?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I know I let my father in in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your father's coming home that evening after your mother was gone?</p>

               <p>Taylor. I cannot say how long after my mother was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It may be an hour and a half, or two hours, to the best of my knowledge, I am sure I let him in about three in the morning; my father ask'd me where my mother was, and I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ask'd you before where your mother was?</p>
               <p>Taylor. To the best of my knowledge he had.</p>

               <p>Taylor. To the best of my knowledge he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put these words in your head ( to the best of your knowledge)</p>
               <p>Taylor. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he came home about three in the morning?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He asked where my mother was gone; or whether she was come in or no? and I told him where she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say then?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I can't say justly; he went to bed, and bid me not go to sleep, and said he should.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been married to your mother?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe 13 or 14 years; I was not quite a year old then, as I have heard.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he use to behave to your mother?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Very sadly, he used to beat her, and would not give her hardly any money, he would spend it.</p>

            . On the 17th of June I lived in Hanger lane, near Acton, in the parish of Ealing, with Mr. Burk, he kept a country-house there; on that day I was going to his house; I came through Acton, it was I believe about nine in the evening I went from London; I did not know my way, I call'd at a public house, there were three women standing at a door; I ask'd the woman of the house, if there was any honest body that could show me my way to my master's door. There was a tallish woman wanted to go with me; the woman of the house said, there was a woman with a child in her arms wanted the momoney, and she would show me my way. I said, I would give her 2 d. or 3 d. that woman came along with me, I call'd for a pint of beer, she and her child drank it; she met with this Boy that has been examin'd, I believe the boy was her son; I did not mind what he call'd her, but she bid him take care of the children, as near as I can guess it was about a quarter after nine when we set out of Acton, we walk'd very hard home, it was near ten when we got home to my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Acton?</p>
               <p>A. Dowland. It is about a couple of miles, she brought me round through lanes. Master's kitchen gate was upon the latch; there was my master's gentleman and the footboy in the kitchen. I told the gentleman, that the good woman came from Acton; we gave her 3 d. and a glass of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her name?</p>
               <p>A. Dowland. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman that was afterwards found dead?</p>
               <p>A. Dowland. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she go from your house?</p>
               <p>Dowland. I believe it was close upon 10 o'clock, the footboy saw her out at the gate, and lock'd the door after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy that has been examin'd here go any part of the way with you?</p>
               <p>A. Dowland. I believe he walk'd a little after us; I spoke to the woman when we were going along, to know why she did not let the boy go too; she said, he had the children to take care of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she was the mother of the boy?</p>
               <p>A. Dowland. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>A. Dowland. No, I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say the woman did not go along with you, and that you never saw her?</p>
               <p>A. Dowland. When Mr. West came to me, I said I did not care to go, I said she went safe from our house, and I had nothing to do with it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner on the 17th?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. I saw him on the evening of that day, he said he was going to see after her; he said he heard she was gone to Ealing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. This was between 10 and 11; he said, if he met her and the other woman, he would be d - d if he did not kill them both; and I told him not to do it; I told him to consider better, to consider his own soul, and not to be so wicked a creature, as he had been all his life-time; he made no answer to that.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him after this?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. That I can't say; he went out directly, he went the way to go to Ealing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him turn that way?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. I saw him the next day, I believe between 8 and 9 in the morning: I ask'd him if he had seen his wife; he said yes, he had seen her; I ask'd him where; he said he would not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about when he expected his wife coming again?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. Yes, I ask'd him when she would come home; he said, he knew she never would come back no more.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. This was not that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What discourse had you with him on that 18th?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. I ask'd him again in the evening on the 18th about her, and said, you must know where she is; he said he did know where she was, but he would be d - d if he would tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him afterwards?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. Yes, about advertising her, but I was not the first that mention'd that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after she had been missing?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. About a week after, I said you had better have your wife advertis'd; for he went from one thing to another, we could not tell what to make of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell one story twice over?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. No; he said she was not worth advertising.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when Mrs. Bonney was there?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. She lives in the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any discourse with the prisoner about his wife after she was found?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. Yes, the very night she was found, and the night after that.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. I was sitting at the door, he had been to see his wife, he came and sat upon the bench; I told him his wife was murder'd in a barbarous manner; he said yes, he believ'd she was; I told him, I believ'd her arms were cut with a knife; he said, they were not by God, they were cut with a sword.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the cuts on her arms?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. I had; I ask'd him whether he knew who killed her; he said one was a soldier, and the other was another man.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this that he made this answer?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. This was on the tuesday after she was found.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner go out that night after his wife, in what manner did he go, had he any weapons?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. He had his sword on (he is a soldier) I am very certain of that, because I desir'd him not to take it; because he said, if he met with his wife and the other woman, he would kill them both that minute.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he inform'd you his wife was murder'd by a soldier and another man, did he say any thing more?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. He desired me never to tell any body, for if I told any body he said he should be hang'd; and if he was hang'd, he said he should walk to me again. I told him he never could.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what his wife wore about her neck?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. She wore a black serrit about her neck.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in the same house where the prisoner and his wife lived?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. About seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time how did he behave to her?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. He behaved very bad indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain it?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. He us'd to d - n her about, and give her slaps on the face, and use to swear he would kill her; I have seen him give her a slap on the face, but no otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100046"/>Q. When the body of the woman was found, did the prisoner say any thing upon that?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. He was not at all uneasy, he was very hardened; he said, he wish'd he had been d - d before his wife was found that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by uneasy, do you mean afraid?</p>
               <p>M. Middleton. He did not seem afraid at all.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Inquire into her character; she has learned every word of this, she is tutored into this, it is not worth while to ask her any questions. She may be called a natural fool.</p>

               <p>Millard. My house is just as you go into Ealing.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to Hanger lane?</p>
               <p>Millard. Pretty near half a mile from it, I had been in bed, the prisoner came and knocked at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100047"/> door, and awaked me, he knocked three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it?</p>
               <p>Millard. It might be 11 or 12 o'clock, or later, I cannot say; I came to the window; said he, have you seen any thing of my wife, or of Mr. Fisher's housekeeper, for they were come to see some butcher at Ealing; he said, where is your man? I said, my apprentice is in bed; said he, let me see him; I call'd my boy up; he came to the window; the boy said I don't know you, nor Mr. Fisher's housekeeper, nor your wife neither, and went to bed again; then the prisoner went away, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What dress was I in at that time?</p>
               <p>Millard. He had his lac'd hat on, and soldier's cloths, to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his sword?</p>
               <p>Millard. I did not see that, nor nothing he had in his hand, nor do I know what he knocked at the door with.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed that night?</p>
               <p>Millard. I believe I went to bed a little later than 9 o'clock; I had bought a calf that very day, makes me positive to the day being tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a clock?</p>
               <p>Millard. No, we have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from Mr. Burk's?</p>
               <p>Millard. It is about a mile distance.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the pond, where the body was found from your house?</p>
               <p>Millard. I believe it is half a mile from my house.</p>

               <p>J. Philbey. In Hanger lane close, by the house I live in; she was cover'd with weeds, that I could not tell at first what it was; I thought it to be a heap of weeds as first; then upon looking I thought it to be a sheep; my master Mr. Sneep was coming home; I asked him to rake it; he took the drag out of my hand and touch'd it, and found it to be a woman, and got a person to take her out; I was by at the time.</p>

               <p>E. Timberlake He us'd her very bad, in such a manner, that a man should not use a woman, nor indeed a man neither; I have seen him beat her very violently; I have seen him knock her down perhaps three times one after another, as soon as she could get up again, with a swingel that we thrash corn with, I thought he would have kill'd her then, and I don't know but he would, if I had not drove him away.</p>

            ; there were enough that would swear to her cloths; I make no doubt the same woman. I saw her two or thee times after she was taken out, she lived as near me as half cross this court; the body was the same size, but the features were not to be discovered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sneep. She was as red as the very fire when first taken out of the pond, and in about half an hour's time, as black as a blackamoor; the prisoner came and look'd at her stockings and buckles, and I believe kiss'd her; and said, God bless her soul, it is for, and away he went.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she fuddled when he knock'd her down three times, as you mentioned?</p>
               <p>E. Timberlake. I think she was not fuddled; I went out upon hearing her cry murder; if people had not went to her assistance at times, I don't know but she had been murder'd before.</p>

            . On the 3d of July I attended the coroner's inquest on the body found in Hanger pond; I found the head was bruis'd, I made an incision in the head, and found a vast quantity of blood lay under the sculp. Immediately upon the scull the parts were very much swell'd; I examined the scull, but could find no fracture there, her nose was beat in up to her face, the bone was quite broke, her tongue very much swell'd, and three inches out of her mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you conceive that might be owing to?</p>
               <p>Hooker. To strangling. I believe her eyes, nose, mouth, and ears were full of blood; there had been a great quantity of blood discharg'd from each of them; the strangling was from the bruises she had had; I examined her neck, and it was vastly swell'd; the prisoner assisted me in cutting off the cloths; in his cutting, I discovered a string; I ask'd him what that was; he said nothing at all; I made him take it out, I believe it was ferret; I ordered him to hang it up; he did.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it cut from her neck?</p>
               <p>Hooker. It was, she had it on when she was found; that had made a great dent in her neck, I was oblig'd to separate it with my finger, there was a very black mark, and a great dent in the fore part of her neck in particular, but it went all round her neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that such a string that a person could be strangled with?</p>
               <p>Hooker. It was; it had strength enough to be made use of 10 times to strangle people, it might be about an inch or more wide.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that string was strong enough to strangle her?</p>
               <p>Hooker. I make no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you believe she came by her death?</p>
               <p>Hooker. She had violent bruises all over her body, and cut in her lower parts by some weapon or other, but I believe she died by strangling, I firmly believe it; her private parts had an external cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Were her cloths cut?</p>
               <p>Hooker. Not as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a stab or a cut on her private parts?</p>
               <p>Hooker. It was a cut, there was a vast quantity of blood from the wounds; she had been violently bruised about her legs; she could not die by drowning, for her mouth was full of blood; upon removing her garters, there were no black marks, as under the serretting about her neck, which confirm'd me in it that she was strangled.</p>

               <p>I was in London at the time, which is seven miles and better from the place. My wife got out of bed from me on tuesday morning about five, and I lay till about six; she went to squire Fisher's a haymaking, I came to London for my cloths, and stopp'd at St. Giles's, and drank with a companion of mine. I went from thence into the Strand, and from thence to the serjeant major's, there I continued till 10 at night, the serjeant's house is in new Tothill street, he is now in Germany; I was very much in liquor, and they would have persuaded me to come home; I came away from Tyburn turnpike, and got there to the plow on the top of Norton hill beyond the turnpike at eleven, there I had a pint of beer; then I went to the coach and horses, and drank two drams of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100049"/> rum, and staid some considerable time, I imagine it to be almost 12 when I went from there; then I kept on the road, to where the two men hang in chains; I went into the penthouse at a smith's shop, where they shoe horses, and sat down there and fell asleep; I got into Acton just between day light and owl-light; when I came home, I wrapp'd at the window as usual a good while.

I went to bed to him, and hearing the clock strike three, I said to him do not go to sleep, he was to go to work at four, I went to sleep. When one Oliver, that lives next door but one to us, came home to dinner the next day, I ask'd him if he had seen my wife; it past on till night, then I enquired; he said she had not been there. When the boy came home in the evening. I ask'd him again after his mother; he said, he did not know any thing but what he told me before; said I, I'll go to Ealing, and enquire at the butcher's; I went there, and ask'd him whether he knew any thing of Esquire Fisher's housekeeper; he told me he knew nothing of her, this was on the wednesday; I ask'd him, if Mr. Munk had ever a man; he said yes; Mr. Munk's man happen'd to be present, and said I am the man; then I went to this man's house, and he was in bed, he came to the door, I ask'd him if he saw Esquire Fisher's maid and my wife; he said no; then I said call your man, if he saw them, he did; he not knowing any thing of them, I went away to another house, and ask'd them, if they had seen her; then I came home, and it was near eleven when I got home; here is the serjeant major's wife to prove I was at her house at ten that night.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Denman. My husband is a serjeant major; I remember the prisoner's coming to our house on the 17th of July last, about five in the evening</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be on the 17th of July?</p>
               <p>Denman. Because there was a gentleman at the sign of the Bell, my husband and he was reckoning, and they set it down.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>Denman. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect most clearly why you say it was on that day.</p>
               <p>Denman. It was the 17th of July last.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was July?</p>
               <p>Denman. I am sure of it, because our cloathing us'd to be done sooner, by the 22d of June, and it was July when they were finish'd now, they were finish'd when my husband went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your husband go away?</p>
               <p>Denman. I can't tell the day, he has been gone 6 weeks last friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had your husband a reckoning with?</p>
               <p>Denman. He had a reckoning with Hen. Smith, I saw it to be the 17th of July, and the prisoner went over to borrow a shilling of my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go away?</p>
               <p>Denman. At almost ten o'clock, it did not want a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Denman. He was very much in liquor sure.</p>

               <p>Denman. Yes, Sir, I am sure we never cloath'd before the 22d of June, and this year it was later.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this was the man that was at your house on the 17th of July?</p>
               <p>Denman. Yes, Sir, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his wife living or dead?</p>
               <p>Denman. I never heard whether she was living or dead, I never heard nothing of her, only when he was first inlisted, then she came to our house.</p>
               <p>Court. Here have been a dozen witnesses who have sworn to the 1th of June to be the day, and the body was found on the 1st of July, and the surgeon examin'd the body on the 3 d, so that if you speak to the 17th of July, you see it was long after the woman's death.</p>
               <p>Denman. Sir, it was the 17th of July when the prisoner was at our house.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible, he was committed on the 9th of July to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Denman. At the night that the murder was suppos'd to be done this man was at our house, at that time.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live in Purple lane, Hatton Garden; the prisoner was quartered at my house, he came for his money on a tuesday, he did not lie in my house, he was paid out of his quarters; I married the widow, he had been quartered upon her ever since he has been a soldier, I never saw him in my life before, I came there, which is about five months ago, his money was 9 d per week.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of him on the 17th of June?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. No, I believe he came the week before he was committed, or that same week, it was not above a week or a fortnight before he was taken up, he came into the house with the corporal about 11 in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the evening?</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I know nothing what became of him in the evening; I know he behav'd very well in his quarters.</p>

            . I keep the Plough at Kensington gravel pits; I never saw the prisoner till a day or two before he was committed, I am not certain as to the day; I remember his calling one evening lateish, and had a pint of beer, I don't know the day of the week, nor can be positive to the time, I believe it might be betwixt 10 and 11 at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he fuddled?</p>
               <p>Tompson. He did not appear to be fuddled; when he was carried by by the officers to go before Mr. Fielding, said he, don't you remember I had a pint of beer at your house one night; I said I do, but I can't tell what night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a fortnight, or more or less, before he was committed?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I believe it might be a fortnight, but I cannot any way be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>
               <p>Tompson. He had on an old ragged frock, and a new regimental hat in his hand, I had some suspicion he had stole it, he said he was going to Acton, and wished he was there; he had no clothing that seemed regimental like; I took the hat in my hand, and said it was the lightest I ever felt.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know serjeant Denman?</p>
               <p>Smith. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember settling any account with him at the Bell alehouse?</p>
               <p>Smith. No other than drinking a glass of punch with him; I never settled any account at all, I never had any account with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any dealings with your master?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, none at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you no dealings with him that required the day of the month to be sat down?</p>
               <p>Smith. No</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember settling any account when his wife was by?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, I had no other account to settle than when I was sent for; I am a soldier in the same company to which he belongs, that account is no other than delivering my old coat when I have a new one, there is no writing to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when it was the company had new cloathing at the serjeant major's?</p>
               <p>Smith. Sometimes one time and sometimes another, this year they have been considerably later than the former year.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in June, July, or August?</p>
               <p>Smith. They do not all receive them regularly; this year it was in July, and some of the men had them delivered out in August, I had not mine till just the troops went abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect whether any of them had their in June?</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100051"/>Denman. I cannot say what the account was, but my husband was reckoning up some account, I can't remember any particular thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person there at the time?</p>
               <p>Denman. There was another man nam'd Carver.</p>
               <p>Smith. I know Carver, he was a soldier in the same company, he had no more account with the serjeant than I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being at the Bell with Carver, and the serjeant major?</p>

               <p>Q. to Mrs. Denman. Have you had time to recollect yourself, what was the day of the month that the prisoner was at your husband's house?</p>
               <p>Denman. It was the 17th of July, I am quite sure of it, this man and Carver were both there when he came to borrow a shilling.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Randal. He did not seem to be much elevated in Liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he drink at your house?</p>
               <p>Randal. He had two three halfpenny glasses of rum.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard of the murder then?</p>
               <p>Randal. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it, that you heard of the murder?</p>
               <p>Randal. Upon my word I cannot tell how long after; I remember I heard by people that came into the house, that a soldier's wife was murder'd, but I can't recollect the first time I heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from Mr. Thompson's house at the Plough?</p>

               <p>Barwick.

               <p>Q. Did you ever keep gold in that cupboard?</p>
               <p>Barwick. I have had many a guinea in it; sometimes when I have chang'd money, but I never us'd to let them lie long there; and I never miss'd no gold from out of that cupboard, I us'd always to put halfpence in that cupboard. and have miss'd a crown's worth at a time. I took him before justice Wright, there he confess'd he took it from me in halfpence, and that it was my property; this was in my hearing.</p>

               <p>Hen. Pain. I live in Broad-street near the prosecutor; I was with the prisoner before the justice, and heard him confess he had stole all that money from time to time from out of a dish in his master's cupboard.</p>

               <p>Jos. Sparrow. The prisoner came into my yard and took a shift and a pair of stockings, that I had seen before hanging in the yard to dry.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. This was on the 25th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her come into the yard?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. No, I did not, but I saw her when she was in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take the shift and stockings?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I suppose she took them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before she came into the yard had you seen the things?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I had seen them about an hour, or an hour and half, before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were in the yard when she came in?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I am sure they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property were they?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. The shift belong'd to my wife, and the stockings were mine; the prisoner pull'd open the shutter of the window, and put up the sash, and attempted to take a sheet that was there, that I saw very plain, I saw her have hold of it; then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100055"/> I asked her what business she had there; then she drawed back. I went and laid hold of her before she got out of the passage; then she dropt the shift and stockings from under her cloak, (produc'd in court, and deposed to) I asked her how she came by them; she would give me no account how she got them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she at any time own how she came by them?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. No, she denied taking them; I charg'd a constable with her, and took her before justice Scott.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said before the justice he found nothing at all upon me.</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I said I found these things upon her.</p>

            . I had been out about my business on saturday the 25th of July at night; when I came home. I was told they had taken a woman, who had taken some cloths from a line; we took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and the next morning, we had her before the justice; going along, we had a great mob of people followed us; we took her into an alehouse, then the mob dispersed, and in the alehouse yard she confess'd she stole the things, and said, she was sorry for what she had done.</p>
