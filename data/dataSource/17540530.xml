               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Jane - . It might be between two and three in the afternoon. They had been gone about three hours, before I saw the child come back again. She set herself down over-against the door, threw her apron over her head, and looked very solitary, but I knew not what was the matter with her then; and last Tuesday was a fortnight the child was examined by a surgeon, whose name is Clark. She was very bad in her private parts, and I observed she looked to be very sore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem to be tore?</p>
               <p>J. - . No, not very much, but looked very red and swelled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blood?</p>
               <p>J. - . No, none; but by her shift I saw she had a running upon her, though what that was I am not acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner a married man?</p>
               <p>J. - . He is, and has been ever since he lived in our house, which is about five months; but how long before I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any children by his wife?</p>
               <p>J. - . No.</p>

               <p>Q. How old is she?</p>
               <p>M. Salter. She was nine years on the twenty-fourth of March last. I went out to wash last Tuesday morning was month, I believe, at four o' clock, and left this girl at home in my room. I came home at eight to breakfast, and the child was there then; I went to work again, and she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175405300003"/> came to me about two in the afternoon, and asked leave of me to go out with

               <p>Q. How did her shift appear?</p>
               <p>M. Salter. It had like corrupted matter upon it. I tied her to one of the bed-posts to make her tell who she was with.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell what the girl said, that is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her body?</p>
               <p>M. Salter. I did, and observed she had a very great sorness upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it inward or outward?</p>
               <p>M. Salter. An inward sore in her private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a sore, or did you see something come from a sore that was out of sight?</p>
               <p>M. Salter. I saw a running come from her, she was very raw and red, and the part was larger than before. I had the child examined by Dr. Harris, who said she had a bad distemper on her. After this the prisoner was taken up, and had before Justice Manleyand then the child was examined by Mr. Clark.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and was desired by the parents of the child to examine it on Monday or Tuesday last, but I do not know which, and I found it had got what we call a clap. Mr. Manley swore me, to whom I told the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other signs upon the child than the venereal disease?</p>
               <p>Clark. I opened its private parts, but could not see any symptoms of force or violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Can a clap be got without penetration?</p>

I observed the woman had a bundle in her arms, which she carried as if it was a child; I went up to her, took hold of her arm, and told her I must see what she had got; but she replied, Not you, you scoundrel. Upon this the man immediately took a pistol from the side of his coat, which flashed in the pan by the side of my cheek, but did not go off; then he dropt it and ran away. We took it up, and found it was loaded deep with swan shot. After this I took the bundle from her, and we took her and that to the watch-house. It was a sack, and in one corner of it was a white cloth all bloody; I unfolded it, and there was in it a man's arm, and the testacles of a man; and in the other corner of the sack was a man's head. We asked the woman a several questions, but she varied in her story. Last of all, she said a gentleman gave her sixpence to bring it from Kensington, and also that she had it of the man that got off, at the corner of a lane. We kept her all night, and the next day she said she had it from the Fox and Bell at Knightsbridgeand that a man gave her sixpence to bring it to Leicester-Fields. We took her before the vestrywhere she still continued to be in several stories, and said that her landlady sent her away with some bacon and greens to her husband, who was at work in the country; adding, that the man who got off overtook her, and gave her six-pence to bring this bundle.

We went into an entry, and Mr. Saunders and he talked together; he asked him some questions, but it being high stile, I did not understand him. Mr. Evans said he would do it for him, and the other replied. I beg you will not disappoint me. Then he asked me to take a walk with him; we went almost as far as Parson's Green, where we had some beer and bread and cheese; he then sent me to the Fox at Knightsbridge, and he turned up a long lain. I staid about three quarters of an hour, and although he had nothing with him when he went, yet when he came back he brought that bundle, and after he had carried it a little way, he desired me to carry it to Leicester-Fieldsand said I should be satisfied for it. I never saw the bag open till I came to the roundhouse, or knew what was in it; nor do I know where Evans is now.</p>

The first indictment charged him with having uttered the bill of Exchange in question, knowing the same to be forged, with intention to defraud Mr. Dickson: that indictment could not be maintained for two reasons; the first, because there was no such person as John Richardson, the supposed drawer of the bill; and secondly, it was not uttered with intention to defraud Mr. Dickson, but Mess. Brown and company. The second indictment against him charged him with having forged the acceptance of Mr. Dickson to a certain bill of Exchange, drawn by one

Mr. Brown then sent for Mr. Dickson, and when he came the bill was shewn to him; he said, The drawer I know nothing of, neither did I order it for payment: and addressing himself to the prisoner, said, Mr. WomerslyI am very sorry to see you the presenter of it, but I had too much reason to belive it was you, from the description Mr. Brown's people gave of your person. He was then taken into a back room, where Mr. Dickson talked to him, and said, WomerslyI do not think you are the only person concerned in this, therefore you had better discover them, that some lenity may be shewed you, or you must be hanged for it. Mr. Dickson, and Mr. Brown had a good deal of talk with him, but he would make no discovery. Mr. Brown (being a quaker, would not take an oath) desired me to go with him before my Lord-Mayor, who examined the prisoner: there he denied knowing any thing of the forgery, but said he had it of this Jones, whom he before named.

               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Vaughan. Between seven and eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Vaughan. No, I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband in the house?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Vaughan. He was; he is a <rs id="t17540530-8-viclabel34" type="occupation">smith</rs>

I saw her take away the gowns, and go down stairs; she dropped both the gowns upon the stairs : she saw me in bedand heard me shriek. I cried after her as she went down stairs; I was in my shift; I went down to the door, and desired my neighbours to call out stop thief. My husband ran after her, and took her in a neighbour's house.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you say that you was half-asleep and half-awake, and that you did not see me go out?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Vaughan. My Lord, I said, that when she came into the room, I did not see her open the door, for I was between sleep and wake.</p>
               <p>Rice Vaughan. I am a smith; I heard my wife cry out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way is it up into your room?</p>
               <p>Rice Vaughan. There is a passage that goes through without coming into the shop. I followed the prisoner, and found her at a green-stall; a neighbour told me she ran in there; I desired her to come back again, for she had robbed me; when I brought her back, my wife charged these gowns upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Vaughan. By the opportunity you had of seeing her when your husband brought her back, Are you sure she is the same woman?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Vaughan. I am sure she is</p>

               <p>Gilbert. He said he had left his own breeches in my room, but I could not find them.</p>

               <p>Jones. I am sure it is mine, here is my mark upon it. (Produced in court.) She was carried before the sitting Alderman, and there confessed she stole it, and that the woman that came with her persuaded her to do it: there was another woman that stood at the door.

            . On Wednesday the 8th of this instantabout seven in the morning, I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner at the bar coming at a little distance on the opposite side the street with something in his hand; when he came up to my door, he said to me he wanted some money, and laid this tankard down on the counter; I having known the prisoner some time before, I asked him who that tankard belonged to; he said it was sent by a creditable person that did not care to come with it himself. I weighed the tankard, but not very exactly : he said he wanted 6 l. upon it; I said it was lending five shillings an ounce upon it; he said that the person could not do with out 6 l. and on Saturday night I should have my money again. I lent him 6 l. upon it about seven o'clock the same evening. I received an advertisement from Goldsmith's-Halland had some reason of suspicion of this being it which was lost. I went out the next morning in quest of the prisoner: he came into my shop while I was gone; I returned, and shewed him the advertisement; he said he had it from a creditable housekeeper, and if I would go along with him, I should have my money again; but I sent for the officer, and took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was taken up, did you hear him confess he stole it?</p>

            . I am constable. I was sent for on the 9th of this instant to Mr. Robson's the pawnbroker; he told me he had stopped a tankard, and had the person in his house, and desired me to take charge of him and the tankard, which I did. ( He produced a tankard.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Robson. Is this the tankard you gave into the care of the constable?</p>
               <p>Robson. It appears to me to be the same tankard which I received at first: when I stopped it there was the remains of the letter T on the handle, which I cannot perceive now, but by the maker's name and the rim I believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. to Darby. Look at this tankard, Is this what you lost?</p>
               <p>Darby. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you had known the prisoner at the bar some time before, What was his character?</p>
               <p>Robson. I believed him to be a very honest manor I would not have taken the tankard of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not bring it to you publickly, as though he came honestly by it?</p>
               <p>Robson. He brought it in his hand in the publick street; I saw him 40 or 50 yards distance from me with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the remains of the letter was on when you took it in?</p>
               <p>Robson. When I came to read the advertisementI made use of my spectacles, and thought I saw something of the remains of it, but I cannot particularly say.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the weight of it?</p>
               <p>Robson. The weight was 25 ounces one penny weight, which was in the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the tankard weigh?</p>
               <p>Robson. It weighed 24 ounces and an half, or three quarters, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he would carry you to the housekeeper that belonged to it ?</p>
               <p>Robson. Yes, he did, but I did not go with him.</p>

When we missed this piece of cloth we examined our standing over, and could not find it; and am always accountable for it till it is paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Dalmear. I missed it between the 4th and 11th of July, in the year 1751.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason you never prosecuted before?</p>
               <p>Dalmear. The people at Blackwell-Hall had bills printed and dispersed about, that if it was exposed to sale, or the like, it might be stopped; and a pawnbroker came to Blackwell-Hall, and said she believed she had it at her house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you dispersed these bills was it that you had intelligence of it ?</p>
               <p>Dalmear. I believe within two months; but that was two yards and a quarter, only part of it, as it appeared by the colour; and as near as I can judge by the manufactory of it, I believe it to be part of what was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that pawned for?</p>
               <p>Dalmear. For eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it worth?</p>
               <p>Dalmear. It was worth 30 or 40 shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear of it?</p>
               <p>Dalmear. I cannot say whether it was a month or two after I missed it; we cannot prove who stole it. It has remained at Blackwell-Hall ever since, to this time. I have compared it with the pattern, and apprehend it to be part of the same, but how that came to be taken away, I cannot tell: I cannot fix any thing upon the prisoner.</p>

               <p>S. Humberston. No.</p>

               <p>S. Humberston. No, never in my life, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Belamy. Is this the woman that brought you the cloth?</p>
               <p>E. Belamy. To the best of my knowledge she is: she had been two or three times at my shop before that, but I did not know where she lived.</p>
               <p>Q. to Humberston. Speak the truth, it will not hurt you?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. I do not remember ever pawning the cloth, or any thing like it, in my life: when Mrs. Belamy first saw me, she could know nothing of menor I of her.</p>

               <p>Q. Look upon the cloth?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. I have seen it three or four times.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath when was the first time you saw that cloth?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. Last week, when the gentleman sent for me. I never saw it before to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>S. Humberston. I don't know the cloak; I had such a child's cloak, but there was a slit up behind.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. It has been to Mr. Wilson's several times, but I don't know whether the cloak is mine or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you say so; the woman says you pawned it with her, and you say it is not your cloak?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. My Lord, I never pawned any thing there as I know of, for Mr. Wilson was the only person that ever I pawned any thing with.</p>
               <p>Court. Regard what you swear; look upon it, and see whether it is your cloak or not.</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever pawn a child's cloak?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. Yes, to Mr. Wilson, please your Lordship; though I never went with it myselfbut always sent the girl.</p>
               <p>Court. Mrs. Belamy swears she knows you, and that you have pawned things with her.</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. I cannot help that.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you say the cloak was pawned at Wilson's, if you don't know where the girl went?</p>
               <p>No answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your child's cloak, wherever it was pawned?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. I cannot swear to the cloak; but if it was my child's cloak, it would have a slit up the back, which this has not, though they say it has been fine drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. How are you certain the cloak was pawned to Mr. Wilson ?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. I cannot tell any further, than that I sent the child with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces of cloth have you carried to Wilson's?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. I do not know; but I carried several remnants.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you them?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. From the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever pawn any cloth of this colour?</p>
               <p>S. Humberston. No.</p>

            . I live upon my estate at Stoke-Newingtonwhich also is situated there, and on Saturday sev'nnight last, as I was going from Mile-End home to Stoke-Newington, my hat blew off, so I got off to pick it up.</p>
               <p>Court. What then you was on horseback?</p>
               <p>Woodcock. A mare backan it please you, my Lord. Then my mare got away, and as I was walking down Whitechapel, looking for my maremuch about Whitechapel bars I met with these two women. I was a little in liquor, and on their asking me if I would give them any thing to drinkI replied I would treat them with a pot of gin hot; upon which they took me down Petticoat-Lane, I believe, and one of them said I should go to her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go?</p>

After this, my Lord, I agreed to give them half a crown apiece to lie between them both, and we went to bed accordingly: - but to tell you the truth, my Lord, I was not concerned with them -  when I awaked in the morning, which was about four o'clock, I found I had lost my waistcoatbreeches, and stockings.</p>
               <p>Court. There is nothing in this indictment but the watch and chain, and sixteen shillings, therefore confine yourself to that.</p>
               <p>Woodcock. I lost my watch and chain, and sixteen shillings and sixpence, according to their confession.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you dont't know what money you had in your pocket ?</p>
               <p>Woodcock. It was something thereabouts. When I had got my breeches and things, my mare was got home.</p>

               <p>Hambleton. Yesmy Lord,

             told me, that in the morning as she lay in bed with the young fellow, she felt the other gropeing about underneath him, and asked her what she was about; she repliedHold your tongue, for I have got his load. Phillips said she saw Preston take some money, and put it into her shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Preston say?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. Preston was not taken by me that night, so I did not see her till five or six o'clock the next morning, when they came and knocked at my door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came and knocked at your door?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. This Jemmy PlumpI think they call him. I got up, and they desired me to go along with them, for that Preston had told them where the watch was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her in custody at any time?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. Yes, on Monday morning. I went along with her to the Jew's house where she left the watch, whose name is

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the watch?</p>
               <p>Hambleton. No, not till it was delivered to my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Who delivered it to my Lord-Mayor?</p>
               <p>Hambleton A person the Jew sent with it.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it she went to the Jew?</p>

               <p>As Phillips and I were going through Black-Horse-Yard, Whitechapel, we met with Mr. Woodcock, who said he had lost his mare, and that he was looking for her. He laid hold of us, upon which we asked him if he would give, us any thing to drink, and he replied he would with all his heart. He insisted on going home to our appartment , for that he was tiredand more fit for sleep than any thing else; so we took him home. When he came into the room, we asked him if he would give us any thing; he sent for a pot of hot, and in the mean time he was for undressing himself and going to bed, but before he was quite undrest, he wanted to have projects and fancies shewed him, which are things that were not at all agreeable; on this we were obliged to tell him one way, and make him think another. He then undrest himself, and insisted on going to bed with us both, giving us. half a crown a piece for that purposeand we went to bed to him. Being abed and asleep, there came one

            . I knew nothing of the loss of these sheets, till the pawnbroker brought them to our house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brewin. I live at the corner of Hosier-Lane, Snow-Hill, and there were two sheets taken in by my journeymanone by my apprentice, and one I took myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner bring any to you?</p>
               <p>Brewin. Yes, my Lord; on the tenth of May she brought one. which I stopt. The sheet produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that it?</p>
               <p>Brewin. It is, and this is the mark which I know it by (which was an S ); she brought another this day three weeks, which I stopt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend any money upon it?</p>
               <p>Brewin. No, my Lord, but she brought me one on the sixth of May, which I took of her, and lent two shillings on it. That also is here. It was produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175405300017"/>Q. Look at that.</p>
               <p>Brewin. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>E. Gundry. That sheet is marked with an S, and there is none but what belongs to my ward that is marked with an S.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gundry. Is that sheet part of the linnen that was under your care?</p>
               <p>E. Gundry. I am sure it is.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brewin. You say you stopt it?</p>
               <p>Brewin. I did, and sent my servant up to the hospitalhaving heard that many had been lost from thence. Whilst he was gone, my spouse, as she was looking out of the windowsaw Mr. Timmswho is clerk to the hospital; upon which I stept out and called him: he came back, and left the beadle in care of the woman. We went before Alderman Alexander, and he committed her to the Counter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gundry. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>E. Gundry. She was as a watch in the hospital to sit up of nights.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this sheet belongs to your ward?</p>

            . No, Sir. I asked him if he was not ashamed to come into people's houses and rob a lone woman; he said, serve you right, you b - h. He broke the other locks, and if he had got them open, he might have robbed me of five hundred pounds value. I never could open them since; they are just as he left them; I must get a smith to take them off.</p>

               <p>William Eagen. I lodge in the prosecutrix's house, and as I came down out of my own room, Mrs. Poor's maid desired I would look into the room to see what the prisoner was about: I looked in, and saw the trunk open, and saw some linnen in it; I ran up stairs, and asked the maid how her mistress came to leave the trunk open; and when we came down there was the flap over the lock buckled too?</p>
               <p>Q. Was the trunk open or shut when you came down?</p>
               <p>William Eagen. It was shut, and buckled down with that strap, and there was either a picklock or key broke in the lock. When Mrs. Poor came home I saw it opened, and there were not all the things taken out.</p>

               <p>Jones. No, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy them ?</p>
               <p>Jones. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him for them?</p>
               <p>Jones. I gave him at the rate of nine shillings and fourpence per hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body apply to you for these hoops afterwards?</p>
               <p>Jones. No; but reading the Daily Advertiser, and finding they were advertised, I went and fetched them from Mr. Humphrey's, to whom they were sold, in order that 'Squire Booth might have them again, and paid the money back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you return them to the owner?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, I did, and he owned them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence, nor called any witnesses in his behalf.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Bibbey. It was about nine or ten o'clock. I asked her which was the way to Long-Acre, she said I do not know, or to that purposeand then added, My dear, will not you give me something. We had some more discourse for about three or four minutes. I told her I did not know whether I would give her any thing or not. We walked on together some yards further, and then we met with two men and two women. Presently after this it came into my head that I had lost something, so I put my hand into my pocket and missed my watch; I then asked the woman for it, but she said she knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that woman?</p>
               <p>Bibbey. It was Collins the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this?</p>
               <p>Bibbey. I laid my hands on her, and thought to have felt it if I could lay hold of the purse, but I did not; then they all came round me, and laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the two men and two women came to you was it that you missed your watch?</p>
               <p>Bibbey. I missed it the very same moment they came.</p>
               <p>Court. So then, who took your watch you don't know?</p>
               <p>Bibbey. No, I did not then; but since that, when we were before the justice,

               <p>Bibbey. I received several blows on my stomach, which I was obliged to be blooded for afterwards. Then they took my money from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Give a particular account of what they took from you.</p>
               <p>Bibbey. They took eight or nine shillings, I cannot be particular which.</p>

               <p>Bibbey. A pocket handkerchief, a pair of leather glovesand a snuff-box. One of them knocked me down, but I was so surrounded, that I cannot tell who it was that gave me the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this?</p>
               <p>Bibbey. I asked them to let me have my watch, and told them that they should be welcome to my money; but one knew nothing of it, and another knew nothing of it; one went one way, the other another, and so I saw no more of them.</p>

               <p>Q. What talk had she and you ?</p>
               <p>Maddox. She asked me which she had best to do, either to surrender, or to be grabb'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the meaning of the word to be grabb'd?</p>
               <p>Maddox. To be taken up by the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not talk the whole out before this?</p>
               <p>Maddox. No, not a word before this. She said she nailed the lodge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her the meaning of that expression?</p>
               <p>Maddox. I did. She said, I took this watch from a man last night, and this man was with me; I want to turn an evidence, and swear against him. I asked her where it was, she opened her right hand, and therein I saw a green ribband, the key, and glass of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in Court?</p>
               <p>Maddox. They are (he produced them). I asked her where the other parts were, and she replied, He has got them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that he?</p>
               <p>Maddox. The other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce them?</p>
               <p>Maddox. No, my Lord. She said, do you be admitted an evidence, for Dolling and I cannot; I replied I am one, and that she should go before the justice. We then went together, and had a pint of beer at the Black Horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this man say any thing ?</p>
               <p>Maddox. No, he stood by at a little distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he hear your discourse?</p>
               <p>Maddox. No, he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after this?</p>
               <p>Maddox. I said let us go this way ( pointing to the publickhouse) but the prisoner Dolling said he would go that way, which was the very contrary to ours, and said he would come back while we were drinking the pint of beer. I then sent for Mr. Bagley the constable, and when he came in, Dolling the prisoner was coming down the street towards the back-door of the house: at that instant I said to Mr. Bagley, This is your prisoner; upon which he went outlaid hold of him, and took this movement from him, being the guts of a watch (producing it). Then the prisoner Collins told Mr. Bagley that Dolling was with her at the time of the robbery; but God knows that, for I do not. Two days after I advertised the watch, with the maker's name, and the prosecutor came to the place mentioned in the advertisement. He informed me he was robbed on such a night; I told him the people were to be at the justice's, and that there he might have an opportunity of seeing whether they were the persons or not. We carried them before Justice St. Lawrence, there the prosecutor described the woman before he saw her, and when he did see her, he said that was she.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more of this affair ?</p>
               <p>Maddox. Yes; she actually said before the justice she took the things from him, and added, Did not you see me give the watch to such a person?</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said but what related to the watch?</p>
               <p>Maddox. No, my Lord, nothing more. She said the other prisoner was the person who took the watch from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Maddox. Yes, I knew her before by sight; she lived in the neighbourhood where I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you say she asked you whether it was proper to surrender?</p>
               <p>Maddox. Yes, she did; she asked me which was bestto surrender or be grabb'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175405300026"/>Q. What business are you?</p>
               <p>Maddox. A perriwig-maker by trade, and an officer belonging to the Marshalsea Court; I was going to arrest a man then.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bibbey. Look on that ribband and seal, and see whether you know them to belong to you?</p>
               <p>Bibbey. They did belong to my watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear to the guts of the watch?</p>
               <p>Bibbey. No, but I can to the dial-plate and the maker's name.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name?</p>
               <p>Bibbey. It is James Green, Gloucester.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Tuesday was sev'night, between the hours of two and three, I was sent for into Peter's-Street, to take charge of the two prisoners at the bar, on suspicion of a robbery: the woman had the ribband, seal, and glass of the watch, and the man at the bar gave me the guts of it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Dolling. Did I make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Bagley. No, he made none. The woman owned the robbing a man in Mary le Bon fields of a watch and handkerchief, and said there were some other people with her, but she would sooner be hanged than tell who they were. I believe Dolling is as innocent as I am: she shewed great enmity to him, and said, she would do him over, as she called it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think she meant by that?</p>
               <p>Bagley. I suppose she meant to have him hanged, she is wicked enough. She never denied robbing a man of his watch (produced in pieces here.) I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman before?</p>
               <p>Bagley. No, I never saw her in my life before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bibbey. You told us you missed your watch, and that you was robbed afterwards of the other things you mentioned.</p>
               <p>Bibbey. I did, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss your handkerchief at the same time your watch was taken away, or afterwards?</p>
               <p>Bibbey. That was taken away afterwards.</p>
               <p>Collin's Defence.</p>
               <p>I met with this man as I was coming home from my work: he asked me the way to some place, and said, he would give me some beer; I said, I was no friend to beer; he then said he would lie with me: I would not be agreeableso he tore my gown to pieces, and took my apron from off my side; with that he threw down his watch upon the ground, and I took it up.</p>

We live with Mr. Barkleyan apothecary; I saw the prisoner at our house between eight and nine o'clock, I was going out, and when I came in again, which was about half an hour after nine, I saw him in the back parlour, and spoke to him there.

            . A short time before ChristmasHiggs, I, and the prisoner, went to this gentleman's house; we had been there several times; there were things lay in the yard continuallyso we got over the wall, and there were a quantity of pewter, brass, and copper in the yard, pots and saucepans, and the like; with that we went into the room joining to the house, lifted up the sash, and unbolted the outside shutter, and this Higgs got in and handed them out to Smith and I.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door locked?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, that was open, the window shutter was bolted; we got all we could light of, copper and brass, or any thing else: there was a large pottage pot and saucepan, the pottage pot was in the yard, and some of the plates and dishes were in the room; there were seven or eight dishes. The prisoner and I stood close to the window, it is but a low one, and bundled the things up, and carried them to Smith's house; he deals in this way; he keeps a bit of an iron shop in Great Earl-Street, Seven Dials. He melted the pewter downand the copper and brass he knocked to pieces; so that nobody could distinguish what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with Smith?</p>
               <p>Lewis. About two years and an half; whatever we stole we brought to his house, and he had a candle burning all night to see what we got: he was not always with us, but came to help us to carry off the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you taken up for?</p>

I went, and asked an ostlen if Mr. Smith's cart put up there; he said, no; but that there was a young man who had been inquiring if a porter had brought any goods; and added, You may leave your goods, for I belong to the Red Lion. Before I could get well from the inn, the prisoner came up to me, and asked me if I did not come from Mr. Nevil's with some goods; I replied yes; where are they says he; I answered, here at the Red Lion, and I believe I am right; yescried he, you are right. He told me the cart was gone before, and that he staid on purpose to receive the goods. He asked me to drink part of a pot of beer with him, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive them of you?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Yes, for I helped them on his shoulder. Says he, They told me it was not above thirty pounds weight, but I believe it is above half a hundred; and seemed to go grumbling away with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you help the goods into the cart for him ?</p>

               <p>Q. What goods were in the parcel?</p>
               <p>Thomas. There was a lump of sugar of thirty-two poundstwo loaves of seventeen pounds and a hal f each, another loaf of eight pounds five ounces, and a pound of tea. After we had had information it was miscarried, I went to the inn and desired the people there, when they saw the man again, to take him up; but turning myself about, I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been absent?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I left him about twelve o'clockand it was about five when I went and made my complaintI then got a constable and took him up; he shewed the constable where the goods were, and delivered them to him.</p>

I met with one Joseph Hill, who asked me where I was going; I replied to seek for business. After this he asked me if I would drink; I thanked him, being very poor and low, and he gave me a full pot of beer. Whilst we were drinking it, he told me he should be glad if I would stay at the Red Lion for a parcel of goods that was to come from Mr. Nevil's, and carry them to the White Horse at Mile-End for him. I went, and asked if there were any goods there from Mr. Nevil's; they said no; then I asked if there was ever another Red Lionand they said yes. In a short time after I met this man, and seeing him read a note, I asked him if he came from Mr. Nevil's; he said yes: says Iyou are right, you must deliver them to me. I called for a pint of beer to make him drink, having threehalfpence given me for that purpose, and then went to carry it up to Mile-End; but as I was going along, before I came to the White Horse at Mile-End, this Hill overtook me (but whether he came out of an alehouse or not I cannot say), then I turned back, pitched the things on a bench, and said I could not carry them; upon which he took them, and gave me sixpence. I came back again, to the Whittington and Cat in Whitechapel, and staid there a little time; and when I went from thence, this man came to me, saying, What have you done with the goods you had of me? I answered that they were gone into the country; then he said his master was cheated. I said, for God's sake let me carry you to the place where the goods are laid; so I carried him there, and delivered the goods to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175405300030"/> him again. I have given all the relations I possibly could to have Hill taken.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you know this Joseph Hill?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I don't know any such man, except he is the person that came and ordered these goods in the name of Edwards.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Lancaster-Court.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you been in practice?</p>
               <p>Moffatt, More than six years. I was sent for to Justice Cox's the latter end of April, but I cannot charge my memory with the day, though I believe it was near the twenty-eighth; there I found Mr. Klik, and was told for what offence he was brought there. I was desired to examine this child, so I went up stairs with the justice and Mrs. Stevenson, and we examined her. I found there had been a forcible entrybut cannot take upon me to say by what; by means of which her parts had been torn. Upon looking at the soreI thought it had an appearance different from what will happen in a common laceration. However, as the prisoner's character was more immediately concerned, I was particular in the account I gave of this. I thought the appearance of the fore denoted the venereal infection, but I said I could not take upon me to say it was the venereal complaint, and that it might have happened through the tearing of the parts; then we came down stairs, and agreed to examine Mr. Kirk. He was called into the little back room, but we found he was so particularly diseased in those parts, with two very great rupturesone on each side, that the two together would appear as big as my head; by means of these the skin of his members were so drawn over, that you could not see them, and on this account we both of us at first sight thought he was a person incapable; but upon recollection we chose to inspect the parts more strictlyafter which we found the penis was capable of being produced. We afterwards examined his linnen, and found thereon such sort of stains, as are generally at the latter end of venereal runnings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find he had got the foul disease on him?</p>
               <p>Moffatt. I cannot positively say so, though there were such appearances which induced me to believe he had had she venereal runningbut near to a cure. Justice Cox bound us over.</p>
               <p>Q. From your inspection of the child, can you take upon you to swear that she had been abused by some man ?</p>
               <p>Moffatt. She has had her parts torn by means of some forcible entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you from the best of your judgment think she has the venereal infection?</p>
               <p>Moffatt. I do,</p>
               <p>Q. From what you observed of the linnen of Kirk, do youor do you not believe he had the remains of the venereal taint upon him?</p>
               <p>Moffatt. I cannot positively say that it was so, but according to my opinion it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe, from inspecting him that he was actually capable of committing this?</p>
               <p>Moffatt. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the child the same day that you was before Justice Cox?</p>
               <p>Moffatt. I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the opinion you gave in before Justice Cox; did not you declare it as your opinion that he could not be capable ?</p>
               <p>Moffatt. At first we thought him incapable, but upon a more particular examination we found he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say upon your oath that he was capable to do it?</p>
               <p>Moffatt. I cannot say, for I never saw him in such a situation.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175405300031"/>Q. Might not a gleet make those marks on his linnen that you saw?</p>
               <p>Moffatt. It might, or it might not; I must submit that to the judgment of the Court. It is probable it might have happened from a venereal complaint, but I cannot say whether it did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say the child had the venereal complaint?</p>
               <p>Moffatt. I will not say so, but I believe so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stevenson. I was at Justice Cox's, and went up stairs with the mother and the child. I examined the child, and found the private parts very much lacerated and inflamed. The child told me Mr. Kirk used to set her upon his knee, and used to put his finger into her.</p>
               <p>Q. From your inspection, do you think the child has been abused?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I do, but with what I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think she has now the venereal complaint upon her?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I will not swear it, but to the best of my judgment I really believe she has. Then I said it would be proper to inspect Mr. Kirkif he will give us leave; and at our first inspecting him we thought it impossible, he having a double rupture, and the penis intirely hid from our sight; but we produced the nutand great part of the penis.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you thinkfrom your inspection, he was naturally capable of an abuse of this kind?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I really believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he had the distemper upon him?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. We discovered that the nut of his yard did not seem to be affected, but there were stains upon his linnen.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think the stains proceeded from?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. I will not take upon me to swear, but I think it was venereal.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Can that distemper be communicated by the finger?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. Yes, I think it may, especially to those parts. There have been instances of people's being distemper'd that way from women, by applying matter to the part, but I do not think he was in so bad a way as to do that.</p>
               <p>

             was one of those he served so. Upon this information I told a neighbour of mine (whose name is Mrs. Dollar) in order for her to tell the child's mother of it. The child told me he had done to her as mentioned by the last evidence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brown. I am mother to the child: she has gone to school to the prisoner's wife for near two years: my servant used to carry her there and her dinner, and she frequently staid till evening. I was sent for by Mrs. Dollar about the latter end of April, who informed me of this affair. I had the child brought out of the nursery, and asked her where she had been with Mrs. Dollar; she said, to give an account of what Mr. Kirk had done to her. I was up stairs with the surgeon at the examining of the child, and found her extremely hurt, and in such a condition, that I never saw any one of her age in before. She was very red, it looked like skin rubbed off from within, and she complained of being very sore. The child told me he used to put his hands up her petticoats.</p>

               <p>Q. Look upon this, is this his hand? (the bill put into his hand.)</p>
               <p>Fender. I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote the body of the bill?</p>
               <p>Fender. The prisoner Watson.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Fender. We compared it with his hand-writing: he lived servant with me about six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write during that time ?</p>
               <p>Fender. Yes, very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Carmarthen his hand?</p>
               <p>Fender. I take it to be so, and the figures too; I have seen him write figures very often.</p>
               <p>Q. What use have you seen the prisoner make of that bill?</p>
               <p>Fender. I was in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the prisoner's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Fender. I believe it all to be his hand-writing, but the acceptance of Child.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>Fender. We do business for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write?</p>
               <p>Fender. I have seen him at the desk writing, we have letters under his hand: I taxed the prisoner, he first of all denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first shewed it to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Fender. The beginning of February, I cannot say particularly what day; he seemed surprised I should charge him with any thing of that kind, but I thought we had sufficient<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175405300034"/> ground, and so had him before Mr. Alderman Alexander.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge him with, having forged the bill, or the indorsement?</p>
               <p>Fender. Forging the bill, but he denied it: he was carried a second time before Alderman Alexander.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge him with then ?</p>
               <p>Fender. He was upon the same charge; he had confessed it to Mr. Shewel, myself, and two or three more gentlemen, before we went before Mr. Alderman Alexander the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the first time?</p>
               <p>Fender. He was in the Counter about a week; he confessed it in Wood-Street Counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the bill at that time with you when he confessed?</p>
               <p>Fender. No, I believe we had not, I shewed it to him when we first of all charged him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever shew it to him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Fender. No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he confess?</p>
               <p>Fender. He confessed he had, at the instigation of other people, forged this bill upon us. I cannot say we produced the bill to him then, but he had seen it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the bill when he was carried the second time before the Alderman?</p>
               <p>Fender. Mr. Ford had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Ford produce it?</p>
               <p>Fender. I will not say whether it was produced or not; there he related a very long story of an accomplice, and how they first got acquainted.</p>
               <p>Q. Acquainted with who, name names?</p>
               <p>Fender. With Mr. Allcroft; he related how they premeditated the thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak particularly of that bill?</p>
               <p>Fender. He did of that very bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Allcroft you mention as an accomplice?</p>
               <p>Fender. He lived formerly in Lothbury, and in Throgmorton-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What relation is he to Mr. Shewell?</p>
               <p>Fender. He is his brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner lived with you as a servant?</p>
               <p>Fender. Six months, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a clerk to you?</p>
               <p>Fender. He would do any thing we set him about.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not a trust upon him?</p>
               <p>Fender. Only to look after the shop; I have trusted him with bills, and found him honest.</p>
               <p>Fender. You say you never saw

               <p>Fender. I said, not to look over his writing, but I have seen him often writing at the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his hand-writing very well known to Mr. Shewell your partner?</p>
               <p>Fender. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And to all the people in the shop (I mean the prisoner's writing.)</p>
               <p>Fender. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of a confession, how long was it after he was charged that this confession was made?</p>
               <p>Fender. I think he had lain in the Counter about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he in great distress and necessity in the Counter, poor and hungry?</p>
               <p>Fender. I do not know, he had money in his pocket as I was told.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make him any promises in order to induce him to confess?</p>
               <p>Fender. No, nothing to that purpose, nor no threats: when I first of all charged him with it, I told him I was very sorry we could have the least suspicion of him; I believe I said, George, you could not do this yourself, you had better discover your accomplices, and things would go favourably with you?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What did he acknowledge at that time?</p>
               <p>Fender. He said he forged this bill.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the bill?</p>
               <p>Fender. The body of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him if he wrote no part but the body of the bill?</p>
               <p>Fender. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he wrote the words

               <p>Fender. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>- Shewel. I never saw the bill till after it was paid, having left a draught for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give that draught to any body?</p>
               <p>Shewel. I left it upon the desk, for the bearer of the bill to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who had that draught?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever shew that bill to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Shewel. I was present when it was shewn to him, and he then denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see it shewn to him a second time?</p>
               <p>Shewel. No, never, as I remember; but it was produced before the Alderman the first time, and he denied it then. I was not before the Alderman the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at any time when the bill was shewn to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Shewel. No; but I was present when he confessed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bill produced then?</p>
               <p>Shewel. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you left the draught payable to the bearer of the billwho received that draught?</p>
               <p>Shewel. They could not tell the namenor who they paid it to, but said it was paid chiefly in moidores. That was all the account they could give.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge the prisoner with any other bill than what was shewn him before?</p>
               <p>Shewel. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner servant to you at that time?</p>
               <p>Shewel. Yes, he was, and he laid the bill in the compting-house witnessed in this manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how it came there? and what did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Shewel. I told him I believed it was a forged bill; he replied he believed so likewise, and added, that a person, whose name was Smith, brought it from Child and company (I saw it witnessed for Child and company): I said it was not David Thomas's hand-writing, and I believed it to be a forged bill; he answered, he believed it to be one too. I went to Child's but no such person ever lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that draught was to go to Child and company?</p>
               <p>Shewel. Yes, to go where we received the bill. The prisoner said he compared it with

               <p>Q. Could any body, except you two and the prisoner, get into your compting-house? was it locked?</p>
               <p>Shewel. They might, for it was not locked.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know there was such a bill ?</p>
               <p>Shewel. The prisoner said it was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that witnessing the prisoner's hand-writing ?</p>
               <p>Shewel. No, it is not; he owned there was another person concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. What person was it?</p>
               <p>Shewel. He said one was Allcroft.</p>
               <p>Q. He is your brother-in-law, is he not?</p>
               <p>Shewel. He is; but he appeared before Alderman Alexander, and was honourably cleared.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew the bill to the prisoner when he confessed it?</p>
               <p>Shewel. He confessed the whole.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose hand do you take that to be?</p>
               <p>Williams. It is in imitation of his, but I do not think it is his.</p>

               <p>Williams. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman Alexander. I remember the prisoner was brought before me, charged by Mr. Shewel and others for forging a bill of forty pounds sixteen shillings they related the story, that the bill was brought by one of Mr. Child's men; that the gentleman left the draught, and the partner was out of town; that when he came home, and came to compare notes, they thought it was the prisoner's hand-writing; they brought several of his letters, and it appeared to be his hand-writing; upon which we suspected he had forged the bill, and committed him to the Counter.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175405300037"/> I at that time sat at the Mansion-House for my Lord-Mayor. After that he came to make a declaration that he forged the bill; that he was acquainted with Mr. Allcroft, who was a relation in the familyand who asked him what wages he had; he said he told him; to which the other replied, that was but a small matter, therefore he would put him into a better method. Accordingly this was struck up; that Allcroft put him upon making this note; that he made two or three before Allcroft approved of any one, but this he did approve of. He said he told his master that Mr. Child's man had been there for the payment of this note; that his master came down (for he was abed he said) and left the draught; that there were three persons concerned; that they met by chance in Holborn; that they had two meetings, one in the fields by Pancras, and the other at Pancras-Wells, and also at several other places. Mr. Allcroft appeared, but this man could not bring one thing to corroborate what he had said was true, so I discharged Mr. Allcroft with great reputation. I remember the bill was produced, both the first and the second time; that he looked at the bill at that time, and said it was forged, and by him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford. I was present before the Alderman the second time, for Mr. Shewel and Mr. Fender desired I would go with them to the Mansion-House to attend upon a very extraordinary examination. Upon their request I went. They said they would do the young fellow all the service they could, if he would make a discovery. I went there to serve him, and this bill was read to him; it was also produced upon the table, and shewn to him, and he said that that very bill he forged by Mr. Allcroft's direction, which gentleman was then present before Mr. Alderman Alexander. He mentioned many circumstances concerning Mr. Allcroft, nothing of which he could prove, and Mr. Allcroft appearing there, with a great many persons of credit to his character, he was discharged with a great deal of honour.</p>
               <p>Pris. Counsel. to Alderman Alexander. Sir, when this young fellow was brought the second time, and charged Mr. Allcroft with being present when the bill was forged, did he not declare that the words

               <p>Ald. Alexander. I do not remember any thing of that mentioned; he did not say any thing in particular, but that he had forged that note by the contrivance of Mr. Allcroft.</p>
               <p>Pris. Counsel to Shewel. When this young fellow was in the Counter upon suspicion, did not you desire him to write a letter to Allcroft?</p>
               <p>Shewel. I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he receive an answer from Mr. Allcroft?</p>
               <p>Shewel. I believe none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that letter before it was sent away?</p>
               <p>Shewel. I did; the purport of it was for him to come to him. Allcroft came to me, and I took him to the Counter face to face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you stay there till twelve o'clock at night?</p>
               <p>Shewel. We did not stay above half an hour, or three quarters?</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make a sort of sham there that you would leave Mr. Allcroft behind?</p>
               <p>Shewel. No, but I desired he would get bail for his appearance; and some people passing their words for him, we took it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Townsend. I have known the prisoner above two years and an half; he was a footman to me about a year and eight months; he behaved well in my service during that time, and was a very sober industrious lad.</p>
