                  </hi>. In Oct., 1849, I was delivery-foreman in the service of the London Dock Company. My duty was at the South Quay Warehouse—I have known Fennell some years, but not to he intimately acquainted with him till about six months before this; about the middle of 1849, I should say—I always understood him to be a commission-agent—in October, 1849, his place of business was at 9 A, Billiter-street, in the neighbourhood of Fenchurch-street—it was my duty to deliver out goods at the Docks, upon presentation of the warrant, after it had been to the office, and had been signed—goods are delivered from loop-holes into a cart, wagon, or any conveyance underneath—a pass would be required, which would pass them out of the Docks—previous to Oct., 1849, Fennell and I had made an agreement that he should purchase some warrants for rice in the market at as low a price as he possibly could, for which I would substitute coffee—the ordinary mode of purchasing coffee lying in the Docks, is to purchase the warrants in the market—in Oct. 1849, there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185103030002"/>
               <p>was some coffee lying in the South Quay Warehouse, on the 28th floor, which had come by the <hi rend="italic">John Grey</hi>—the prisoner and I made an agreement about it; he informed me that he had bought the rice, or purchased the warrant for it (for lot 108, I believe); and as soon as I had any bags of coffee ready for him, he would come and fetch them away—we always deliver by lots—the whole of the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">John Grey</hi> was not rice—he said he should send the warrant down on a certain day, for four bags, when I was ready—there were at that time many thousand bags of coffee warehoused there—on 17th Oct., 1849, this warrant (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought to me; I received it; it is a warrant for sixteen bags of rice, upon which is endorsed an order for four, upon which I had the power of delivering four bags, and no more—I do not exactly know the man's name that brought it—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, was a warrant for sixteen bags of rice, imported in the</hi> John Grey, <hi rend="italic">July,</hi> 1849, <hi rend="italic">deliverable to Erhnfeldt and Co., on which teas endorsed,</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Please deliver four bags to bearer. W. B. Phillips. for Shentin and Co,</hi>")—(<hi rend="italic">Elston was here brought into Court</hi>)—that is the man who brought the warrant to me—the warrant is generally for a portion of the goods only—it is very seldom that the whole is delivered at once—these are my initials on this order; when they are put upon it, it goes to the office, to be counter-signed, with a pass-note, which I give at the time; the counter-pass is then given for the delivery out of the Docks—on receiving this order, I took four bags of coffee from the stores from the South Quay Warehouse—it was in bags which I had made up from the Company's stores—I deliv<lb/>ered the bags of coffee to Elston's truck, or rather to Cox's truck, and delivered him this pass—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Pass Cox's truck, with four bags of rice, 389, 108, 588, and 322, ex <hi rend="italic">John Grey,</hi> by order of Erhnfeldt and Co. William Compton, foreman")—bags of coffee are made up in the same way as rice, in gunny bags—I received from the prisoner for this transaction, at the rate of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound on the coffee, after deducting the price the rice-warrants had cost him.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185103030003"/>
               <p>I gave information—I did not apply to the Customs for a situation when I came out of prison—I did not apply to them before Jan.—I have never been in prison on any other occasion; I am quite positive of that—I have been charged once; that was for misdemeanor, I suppose you call it—I was going through the street, and saw a <hi rend="italic">row;</hi> a policeman taking a man for being drank and disorderly, or something of the sort; they pulled the man along roughly; I said, "Allow him to get up, and he will walk quietly;" subse<lb/>quently be was released by his acquaintances, and I was taken into custody; taken before a Magistrate, and fined 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was not for assaulting the police, bat for assisting the prisoner, intercepting the policeman in the execution of his duty; it was while I was in the service of the London Docks—I have been in their service nearly thirteen years—I am positive I have never been charged with anything else—I was only on that occasion before a Magistrate, or before any tribunal previous to this transaction, only at that time—I have never been in custody, or charged, since I was discharged—I made these bags of coffee up from the stores in the Company's warehouse, or bags which ought to have been delivered; I made them up—I am not acquainted with the value of the coffee sweeping!—I should say 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound would not be along price, considering the duty would be 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound upon the sweepings, or any coffee—I did not find the sweepings on the floor, and make them up; they were taken into No. 52 floor, in the warehouse, and I took them from there in the clean state; that is what I mean by making them up.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Made up on your own account, or by the direction of your employers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my own account, in pursuance of the arrangement I have spoken of with Fennell—the coffee was not balked—it was in casks in No. 52 floor, after it had been cleaned and picked, and it was out of those casks I took the coffee in question—it was good, and quite clean; good merchantable coffee—it was good sound rice that came by the <hi rend="italic">John Grey—l</hi> do not know whether the duty on rice is 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a hundred weight; It. a hundred weight I think.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said you were discharged from the docks for substituting one bag of coffee for another, what do you mean by that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well; when an order came for delivery one bag could not be found, and the beg was taken from the same cargo, but from the following lot—I discovered it myself—it was discovered by the Customs—they called the attention of the Dock people to it, and I was discharged by the Docks, and prosecuted by the Customs—if the rice-warrants cost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the market, that would have to be deducted from the price the coffee fetched, and the remainder we were to receive 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound upon—I do not know the price of the coffee—I never knew what price it fetched—I have seen it quoted in the price list from 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a hundred weight, but perhaps more than that—I have seen those prices—I have seen rice quoted at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but am only speaking of what I have seen in the price list.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Bartlett's-buildings, Smithfield. I carry out goods—in Oct., 1849, I saw the prisoner in the London Dock—he said he wanted me to take four bags of rice from the Dock to his place—I said, "Very well, sir," and he put down his name and address on a small slip of paper which I either tore up or lost in some way or another—I have not looked for it lately—I understood that his name was Fennell—be gave me the warrant for the delivery of the four bags—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I presented it at the South Quay Office, London Docks—they gave me a delivery order, and I took the warrant and delivery order to Compton the delivery foreman, after asking a question about the delivery—I had a truck there—Compton delivered the four bags to me according to the warrant, as I expected—I took the truck nearly opposite the South Quay Office, and left it there to apply for a pass—this is the pass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I received it at the South Quay Office after I received the four bags—this small ticket is the pass the Company gives—that did not come into my hands at all—it was taken into the office by Compton—the pass enabled me to get through the gates, and I went to Billiter-square to Mr. Fennell's—I saw a lad named Collins, and took the bags into bit counting-house—I saw coffee sticking outside them—Fennell came in after I had delivered the last bag, and paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I was never out but once, about five or ten minutes to four o'clock, and I was gone about eight or ten minutes—I was not in Ramsay-street that day with a mask on—the policeman came about half-past eight in the evening with the prisoner, who said, "That is the woman"—I said, "What! have you come to bring further trouble? this is something you have made up"—she bung down her bead and said nothing—I was after<lb/>wards tried for attempting to murder Mrs. Parnell, and acquitted—the prisoner knew my person well—I have known her eight or twelve months only by bringing work to my house.</p>

George Hopwood has out Jane Parnell's throat"—I said, "Bless me, cut Jane Parnell's throat, why how is that?"—"Oh," she said, "I really don't know, for I neither saw nor heard nothing about it, though I was in my own room, standing at my own door"—Ramsay-street is a very few doors from Abbey-street—I know the spot where this is said to have taken place—a person standing at that door could not dis<lb/>tinguish the features of persons there—there are weavers' houses in Ramsay-street—persons who called out in the street would be heard—on 3rd Dec. I was at Worship-street—about five minutes before the witnesses were ordered out, the prisoner came to me, and said, "Mrs. Callow, I never saw nor heard anything about it"—I said, "What you don't know you cannot say, and keep yourself out of further trouble"—I did not go before the Magistrate the second time; I was not called upon, and in my situation I did not think it was proper—I told Mr. Heritage what the prisoner had said to me, after the Hopwoods were committed.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. David William Wotton and another; they are gun-manufacturers, in Great St. Helen's—the prisoner was their warehouseman—he had a cupboard to his bench, which is usually kept locked. On Thursday night., 24th Feb., I bad his cupboard unlocked, after he was gone, with a key that we had to fit it—I found in it thirty-one bayonet-springs—I locked the cupboard and left them there—I made a report to the foreman next morning—I had the cupboard unlocked every night after that, and still saw the springs there—on the Monday night following I told one of the servants to unlock the cupboard—I did not see it opened—the servant told me something—I went to Bishopsgate-street and overtook the prisoner—I asked him to come back, and he did—he had a parcel in his band, which was three dirty aprons—I asked him to unlock the cupboard, and I saw him do so; the springs were not there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185103030011"/>
               <p>—asked him for the thirty-one bayonet-springs—he seemed confuted, and walked about; he did not say anything—I said if he did not give me the springs I should give him in charge—after a short time he took twenty-five springs out of one of his pockets, and six out of the other—I told him to go about his business, and to come the next morning to see his employers—these springs were usually kept in a floor over his head—I do not know these springs at all, but I had missed some for some weeks—the prisoner did not come back on the Tuesday morning, but, he came on Wednesday—he said he was innocent, but be said he had gone up to my floor and taken the thirty-one springs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a die-sinker, in Rupert-street, Haymarket On Thursday, 23rd Jan., O'Shea came to my house between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning—my son handed me this note, and said, in his presence, that he had received it from O'Shea—(read)—"Sir, I want to know whether you would have the goodness to make a cast for two half-crowns; and if you do, what you will charge; you will be paid liberally and faithfully, and depend upon the strictest secrecy"—I read the note, and asked O'Shea what he wanted—he said a mould to make half-crowns—I appeared surprised, and told him that was decidedly wrong—he said, "We know it is not right, but we want to make them"—he said they wanted to pass them—I asked him to describe what he wanted—he said his comrade was outside, who could explain it better than he could—I requested him to fetch him—he did so, and Mulcharey came in—I said to him, "I suppose you are aware what is wanted here"—he said, "Exactly so"—he said he wanted a steel die made for half-crowns—I asked him if it must be in steel—he said, "O certainly, nothing else"—I made a sketch on paper and showed it him—he said he wanted it large, to make two at once; and he made a sketch with two on it; and he sketched the mode in which the channel was to be made—O'Shea was standing by at the time—Mulcharey described to me the channel that he drew—I undertook to do it, after settling about the price, which I told them would be about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—O'Shea offered me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said he could get it done for less in Birmingham, but he did not want to go further if I could do it—I at last agreed for the price of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then asked them how they came to come to me—Mulcharey</p>

               <p>trailed, and said, "You see we found you out"—in subsequent conver<lb/>sation I inquired how they came to me, and they said they had a letter from a person in Ireland to an engraver in the same street—there had been an engraver in that street, but he is dead—they were to come back on Monday, 27th—on the day they first came I went to the police-office and informed the inspector what had taken place—I gave the note and the sketch to the inspector; and in consequence of instructions I went on with the pro<lb/>ceeding—on Monday, 27th, Mulcharey came alone, in the morning—I had prepared the mould, and showed him what I had done—in the evening both the prisoners came, and said they wanted it done by Thursday, as they wished to return to Cork—Mulcharey said he should be able to put a great many pounds in my pocket, that they should want a great deal done in that way, and the next mould would be to make sovereigns—I think it was Mulcharey said that—O'Shea was there—the prisoners then came almost daily to watch the progress of the mould—on 7th Feb. O'Shea came alone; he saw the mould; and he presented to me two Bank of Ireland notes, one for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked me if I would make-some notes of that description—I told him it could be done, and asked him what they were for—he said he could pay the rent to his landlord, and he would make them good—he left the notes with me—I had com<lb/>municated to the inspector about the note and the sketch; and I did also about these notes—on Monday, 10th Feb., I saw both the prisoners about the notes; they were anxious to have them done very quickly—O'Shea said some of his neighbours were rising rapidly in fortune by forged notes, and he wanted a good supply too—he said that they supplied them at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each in London and Liverpool, But he did not know exactly where to get them, and he wished to have plates of his own—I showed them the mould at that time, it was nearly finished, and they were to come to try it the next evening, the 11th—on that evening they both came again, and O'Shea brought some tin in his pocket, which he melted in the ladle, and I poured it into the mould—both the prisoners then said that the channel was not sufficiently large to allow the metal to flow quickly—I undertook to alter that by the next day—they went away, and they both came on the next day, Wednesday—O'Shea brought a little more tin, and it was melted again, and the mould tried as before—I was paid the balance for the mould—I bad already received half of it—O'Shea paid me all the money—the balance I received on that Wednesday was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—O'Shea gave, me his address in Ireland—the notes were to be sent there—I was to make the notes entirely, and send them ready made—I was to make a small tool to repair the edges of the half-crowns—they took the mould away with them—I bad arranged with the police, and the prisoners were taken the same day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Bishopagate-street. On 26th Feb. I was going into Mr. Allen's shop—I saw the prisoner leaning across the counter, with the till half out, and his hand over the counter—I went to the parlour, and asked Mrs. Allen if she had not something better to do with her money than to allow it to be taken sway—Mr. Allen came up to the parlour, and I accused the prisoner of robbing the till—the prisoner said, "I have nothing on me"—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued.</hi>) This order was executed out of my cloth and material—I do not know who took the jacket away; but shortly after, I received a letter by post from Lieut. Dowse, which I handed to the prisoner, saying, "How it this, Lieut. Dowse writes to say he has not ordered this jacket?"—I do not remember the precise words he used, but I think it was, "I dare say Lieut. Dowse is not aware I am here; I will go down and see about it," and he left for the purpose of going, taking the letter with him—next morning he brought the jacket, and said it was all right, he had tried it on to Lieut. Dowse, and it was rather tight under the arm, and required a little alteration; and it was sent into the workshop for that purpose—I did not see it after that—here is an entry in my delivery-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a portion of it in my son's writing, and a portion in the prisoner's—the prisoner's writing is, "Delivered to servant, by J. Donegan," and that is written under "Tuesday, 8th Oct., 1850, Lieut. Dowse, Royal Artillery, one blue shell jacket"—I discharged the prisoner in Dec., and he entered the service of Mr. Stovill about 1st Jan.—I believe I afterwards sent for him to come to my place, and requested Mr. Stovill to come with him—I had to apply to him several times—I did not see him myself—I wrote to him, and sent Mr. White and some other of my people—he was at last found in the street, and brought by Mr. White—I called his attention to Lieut. Dowse's account in my ledger, and said, "Is this account of Lieut. Dowse, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., correct?"—I had the ledger open—I do not know whether he saw the account—it is in my clerk's writing, but the prisoner was aware of what it was, because he had put the prices to it him<lb/>self—he said, "Yes, it is correct"—I said, "Recollect about this shell jacket"—he said, "Well, that is not delivered"—I asked him whether Lieut. Dowse had had it, and he said, "No"—I asked why, and he said Lieut. Dowse was absent on leave—I said, "Where is it?"—he said it was somewhere, mentioning some name which I forget, and I said, "Then you</p>

               <p>will give me an order for it"—he made these several attempts (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) to write an order, but was too nervous to write, and Mr. Stovill wrote an order, which the prisoner signed—I called his attention to other accounts in the ledger, and afterwards gave him into custody.</p>

Dowse's order for a shooting-jacket, on 22nd Oct.; his reply was, I wrote it down at the time, "Donegan says he has seen the lieu<lb/>tenant wear them."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dancing-master, of Grove-terrace Victoria-grove, Stoke Newington. On 23rd Jan., about nine o'clock at night, I was going home across the Haggerstone-fields, towards Dalston—there are lights at the extremity of the fields—the prisoner came near me—I am sure of him by his voice and his height—I could not see his features, it was too dark—he said it was a dark night; I said it was—I saw no other person—I said I had missed the footpath; he said, "Oh never mind, I am used to the place"—I said the lights at the further corner of the field were sufficient direction for me; he went a little way</p>

               <p>to the right, and I saw some other persons; I could not say how many, it was so dark—the prisoner crossed from the right to the left, and came to a place where one part of the ground was higher than the other, a sort of embankment—he said, "Here is the path, sir; give me your hand, and I will assist you"—I gave him my hand, and another man came behind me, and pulled me by the feet—I called for assistance, but he got me down—the men over me did not allow me to call long—while lying there the prisoner cut my trowsers at the right-hand side, and took out the pocket, containing my purse, twelve sovereigns, half-a-crown, two shillings, and a check for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they then got hold of my watch-guard; the swivel broke, and left my watch in my pocket—they got the chain; it was a metal one—the prisoner said to the men, "Hold him down"—he had a short shooting-jacket, and a cap—my hat and watch-key were brought to me next morning—I gave my trowsers to the police—on the Saturday week afterwards Morrell took me to the station at Hoxton—the prisoner was brought down-stairs with two other persons; Morrell spoke to him, and I knew him directly by his voice—I have not the least doubt about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 38, York-street, St. Luke's, and am a linen-draper. On the afternoon of 13th Feb., the prisoner Maine came and bought a ball of cotton, paid for it, and went out—directly she was gone Mrs. Mills came and spoke to me; in consequence of which I went to the shop porch, and missed this piece of print (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I had seen safe a quarter of an hour before—I went through several streets; through King's-square, which is a quarter of a mile from my shop, and at the corner of Wellington-street, Goswell-street, I saw Jones, Sullivan, and Loader—I laid hold of Loader; I found she had nothing, and let her go—I then took Jones, and found she had the print in her apron; I said, "You have my print in your apron"—she said some one had given it her—I told her I should take her to the station, she begged me not to, and made great resistance—as we were going, some one gave her a knife, and told her to stab me, and she cut my band, but did not hurt me—I took this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) away from her—in the evening Maine came to my shop with two women, who said they were Jones's mother and sister, and offered to pay for the print—Maine said they were outside together, and Sullivan gave her a penny, and sent her in for the ball of cotton—she said nothing about the print.</p>

About 10th April, 1850, the prisoner came to me, and took a lodging—he said he was a baker—I asked where he worked—he said he had been three years in a situation in Fenchurch-street, but had heard of a situation at Deptford, and was going to work that evening—I forget what name he said—he said he wished to come in in the morning, and sleep in the day, as he worked at night—he came at eight o'clock next morning, and I showed him the room, which was a top one, at the back of the house—I asked what time he wished to get up, and he said about four in the afternoon—he came down about half-past three, and I said, "You are up earlier than you wished to be called"—he said he was awake, and thought he might as well get up—he asked for some boiling water, and went out to get a piece of bacon, but he never came back—I did not see him till he was in custody—my room is on the same floor as the one he occupied—I afterwards missed from my drawers there 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In money, a silver watch, gold pin, a brooch, watch-chain, a silk handkerchief, and a pair of stockings—the drawers had been unlocked and locked again—I left them safe at seven in the rooming—no one besides the prisoner was up-stairs, except a lady who lodged on the next floor, and who is still lodging a few doors off—she continued with me four months after this—the house is my dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a currier, at Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell, and have one partner. On Tuesday, 4th Feb., the prisoners, who I knew a little of before, came to our shop with Mr. Bull, who is a collar-maker, and a respectable man—Butler said, "We have brought a person to look at those hides"—he did not say the number, but they had seen twenty-seven japanned horsehides previously—they were worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had told them I would take 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per hide, and told them to bring a customer—Mr. Bull asked me the price I would take for the hides, and I said I had left it to these men—they all went away together, and in about a quarter of an hour the prisoners returned, and Butler told me Mr. Bull would take one hide on trial, and if he approved of it he would take the whole, as he had had some before and did not like them—White was at Butler's side, and must have heard what he said—he approved of what Butler said, but I cannot say what words he used—they seemed <hi rend="italic">congenial</hi> together—on the Saturday previous Butler had told me, in White's presence, that White and he worked into one another's hands in doing business—the same afternoon, the 4th, Butler told me he had got au order from Mr. Plowman, who I know is a collar-maker, and a respect<lb/>able man, for ten hides for approval—on the 3rd, Butler had said they wanted some harness for Mr. Beale, and a horsehide to try as approval for a person, and he and White looked them out together, and they amounted to ninety-six pounds of leather—they told me Mr. Bull lived near the City-road—on the Tuesday, I left our place with the prisoners in our cart, tak<lb/>ing eleven horsehides, and ninety-six pounds of leather—we went to Mr. Bull's—Butler got out, took one hide, and I saw him go in with it—in about five minutes he returned, and said we were to make haste to Mr. Beale's as we were to see him at five o'clock—he had left the hide at Mr. Bull's, and said he thought it would suit him—he said he had seen Mr. Bull—White said that Mr. Beale had remarked that our hides had not suited him before—we drove to Mr. Beale's—Butler took in one bundle, and White the other of the ninety-six pounds—I did not then go in, but I did a few minutes after with Butler—he had said Mr. Beale would not be at home till ten, and Butler said, "Mr. Beale will be at home at ten," and the foreman said, "Yes"—we then went to Mr. Plowman's, in North Audley-street, and they each took in a bundle of the ten hides—I went to a public-house opposite, and in a short time Mr. Plowman, Butler, and White came, and White kept me in conversation while Butler talked to Mr. Plowman—I heard Butler say to Mr. Plowman "at eleven o'clock," and they went out—I did not go with them into Plowman's, because I did not like to interfere; it was rather a delicate question; if they were to make a few shillings by it, I did not like to take it from them—Butler returned, said the hides were all right, Mr. Plowman was engaged, but we were to call at eleven—I had got two enamel hides in the cart, and we took them to a leathercutter's in Crawford-street—White took a hide in, and Butler sat with me in the cart, and Butler went in afterwards—he afterwards gave me the money for that—we then got into the cart, and rode down Oxford-street, where they got out, and Butler said they would meet me at eleven in the morning—I said I would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185103030067"/>
               <p>rather they would come earlier, before ten; and White said, "We had better be to the time"—it was agreed they were to be at our place at nine, and I went home in the cart—I think they left me about a quarter-past eight—they did not come next morning, but in the afternoon Butler came and said he was selling leather in St. John-street, and he would call the next morning—I did not see them again till they were in custody—I have only received the 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the one hide—the one left at Mr. Bull's was 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the ten at Mr. Plowman's 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the ninety-six pounds of leather at Mr. Beale's 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have seen one hide since at Mr. Covey's, Little Leonard-street, which I believe to be one of them—this is a part of it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Mills; I live at 46, Georgiana-street, Camden-town. I went to the shop of Mr. Anderson, a trimming-maker, 76, High-street, Camden-town, about a quarter after six o'clock, to purchase some braid and buttons—I had a bag on the counter—I had a pone in it—I took it out of the bag to pay for the articles—after paying for them I had one shilling and a penny change; I put them into my glove—there was then some bills in one end of my purse—my purse was on the counter when I took out the half-crown to pay for the articles—I noticed a person looking at me while I was paying—there was a little girl about twelve years old between the person and me—I was not able to see his face, only his eyes—I noticed them; they were fixed on my purse—I heard him ask for three-eights of alpaca—Mr. Dale served him, and about three minutes after<lb/>wards I left the shop—I had put my purse in my bag—I went round Greenland-place—as I came to a post, the prisoner was there with his back towards me—he seemed to come from the road to Bayham-street—when I was crossing, he sprung round and snatched at my bag; it was twisted round my hand—I had not so much opportunity of seeing his face as his figure—he pulled my bag, and struck me at my throat—he dragged me three or four yards down Greenland-place—he then gave another tug, and the strings broke, and he left the strings with me and ran away—I could not scream until I got halfway down the court, and then a person in shirt-sleeves came up and pursued him till he was lost sight of—I did not see the prisoner again till he was brought to me on the Monday night by the officer—I noticed the eyes of this man fixed on my purse in the shop, but it was so instantly done I had not an opportunity of seeing his face—the prisoner is the person that robbed me—I say that from his appearance</p>

On Tuesday evening, 4th Feb., the prosecutrix came to the shop, about half-past six o'clock—Miss Furley attended to her—there was a little girl in the shop, and the prisoner was next to the little girl—he was purchasing some alpaca; I cannot say whether it was 3-8ths or 5-8ths—the prosecutrix left the shop first, and the prisoner left about a minute after—I had known him before well—the prosecutrix came to the shop the following day, and I gave what information I could.</p>

I saw the child immediately it was brought, and perceived it was labouring under the effects of some narcotic poison—I used the stomach-pump, and pumped in about half a pint of warm water—I then drew from the stomach an opaque fluid, which smelt strongly of gin—I then pumped in a strong decoction of coffee, and used friction to the surface—the child was then collapsed and cold—after she was in the bath, she rallied slightly; reaction came on afterwards, and she died from inflammation of the coats of the stomach and membranes of the brain—gin having been administered was the cause of death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was she brought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten o'clock, or a little before—if the stomach-pump had been used an hour before she was brought to us, the child would have been living now—she died not from the gin that was found in the stomach, but from the gin that was absorbed—I cannot speak as to the quantity of gin.</p>

The prisoner has been my shopwoman nearly twelve months—I have several other young women in the house, engaged in dressmaking, but not in the shop—on Tuesday evening, in consequence of something that had hap<lb/>pened, I sent for a constable, and after he came I sent for the prisoner into the room—Mrs. Gunton was there, and I said, "Mrs. Holder, I want an explanation respecting this lace; this lace that you have had on your garments is precisely the same as the one Mrs. Gunton has just made op for herself"—the prisoner said that the milliner who made the gown had procured it for her, and put it on—we then asked who this person was; and she stated the name of the person, but said she was out of town—we then asked her where we could ascertain whether she really was out of town or not; and the statements she made were altogether unsatisfactory to me—I then said, "We should like to look into your boxes"—she made no objection, and we went up-stairs—she unlocked</p>

               <p>one of her boxes; turned over a great variety of things, several lengths of ribbon, many hundred yards of thread-lace, and among them were these two pairs of pink gloves—I asked her where she obtained them—she said she had them before she came to my house—I said, "These gloves are my property; I can swear to them; they have a private mark in the inside"—after she had turned over that box, she went to another, unlocked that, and in it was found a piece of diaper, which has my own private cost price on it, and which I also said I could swear to—she said she pos<lb/>sessed it before she came to live with me—I found several other things that I have no doubt are my property, but which I cannot swear to—I gave her into custody—she began to cry, and begged me not to do so—I said I had a duty to perform to the public, myself, and the other young people in the house, and I felt it my duty to do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On 27th Jan. he came home, put his coat on a chair, and walked into the back-yard—I saw two persons respectably dressed outside, one of whom I had seen on the Thursday before, who came into the shop when Mr. Harriss was not at home—it was the prisoner—he had come in, and asked for the master, and said he wanted a suit of clothes made—I said he was not at home, and he said he would call again as he came from his dinner, but he did not—that was about two o'clock—on this occasion, the 27th, he came in, and I saw a man outside keeping an eye on him and me—the prisoner said, "Is the master at home?"—I said, "Yes," and waited to see if my husband would come, as I saw a man peeping through the window—he did not come, and I went through a little passage to the back-door to call my husband; he came immediately—the prisoner, who was keeping the door half open, asked him what he would charge to make him a suit of clothes with his own cloth—he said 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner said it was very reason<lb/>able, and he would call to-morrow to be measured—when my husband came in, he was going to shut the door; I said, "Don't shut the door, because there is a gentleman outside, a companion of this gentleman, waiting for him"—my husband looked out to see if he could see him—the pri<lb/>soner said, "No, he is gone in somewhere to wait for me," but I saw some one going away while my husband was shutting the door—he passed the door as my husband was shutting it—he seemed to have something hang<lb/>ing on his arm, I could not say what—there was time for the prisoner to have given the coat to the other man while I went to call my husband—On the Saturday week following" the prisoner came again, but very differently attired—my husband was not at home.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks at Marlborough-street Police-court. I produce an information which was exhibited at the police-court on 6th Feb.—that information was laid by the defendant, before Mr. Bingham—it is a complaint that the Earl of Stamford and Warrington was the father of a bastard child, of which she had been delivered—she signed it—it is dated 6th Feb., 1851—I have no doubt it was read over to her; that is the practice—it was not taken by me.</p>

I went to lodge at Mrs. Hill's—I went by the name of Sheridan there—I remember Lewis coming to me in Goodge-street—I was going in my own name then—Maria Ball persuaded me to go by the name of Sheridan—I applied to Mrs. Hill for lodgings for myself and another, and a person to nurse me—I took it as Mrs. Sheridan; I went out that night and returned about nine with Lewis—Mrs. Hill remonstrated with me for bringing a man—I said it was my husband; I knew he was coming—he passed as Mr. Sheridan—he was not drunk—Mrs. Hill did not come up<lb/>stairs and find Sheridan and me in bed together—Miss Lewis asked if I could be accommodated with a little coal if anything happened—it was a double bed-room—several gentlemen came while I was confined, amongst them Sheridan—I am quite sure of the day of the birth of my child, it was nearly a week after I was at Hill's—Sheridan did not sleep with me the Saturday, Sunday, or Monday—the Wednesday after Johnson, my brother-in-law, came and saw me—he asked me if I'd had that fellow there—I told Mrs. Hill, Sheridan was my husband—my brother said, 'Now,. Mary Ann, what do you think of yourself, and the fellows of this town'—Mrs. Hill came and said she had been told I was not a married woman—I said, 'Oh, yes, I am'—she did not say 'If you are married, where were you married?"—I did not say at Shrewsbury—she did not say she was a native, and which of the two Churches was it—I told her the mar<lb/>riage-lines were in Sheridan's pocket—I did not say to her the coat was in pledge, I said so to Lewis; that was a story—Sheridan did not come that night, nor in my bedroom, and undress himself partly—after my confinement I used to sit in the kitchen—she (Mrs. Hill) did not say, 'You will think it very hard of my not letting your husband come, if I was mar<lb/>ried'—I never told Mrs. Hill I went from my father's house to get married to Sheridan, and had spent about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and pawned all my clothes, and that I had been with Sheridan nine months—Sheridan was in the house the night I was confined—Mrs. Hill took the child down for him to see—I never said to her the child was Sheridan's—I was out not more than one night; I sat up all night at Mrs. Waters's—Sheridan was not with me—I vas not out three nights—I told Mrs. Hill I had been sitting up at Mrs.</p>

Rogers and Lewis paid the midwife; I gave Jane Lewis 3. myself—I recollect being here for the summons—we did not go to Goodge-street, and inquire for a coffee-house, or to Tottenham Court-road; we went to the Mews—I saw Sheridan that day at a coffee-shop, opposite where I am staying—Lewis was with me—I have not seen Sheridan since—on 26th Jan., about seven in the evening, I was in Goodge-street, in company with Sheridan, my child, and another—I applied to a milkman to know where I could get lodgings—I went to Matthews's; had two rooms, one was for Lewis, the other for me and my baby, nobody else—Sheridan had a bed to himself with the little boy in another room—on 31st Jan. I went to fetch Lewis, and returned with her next day—we staid there till the day before we applied for the summons—Sheridan did not say it would not do for him to stay with me after the summons was taken out—I and Sheridan did not sleep together at Matthews's, or the other house; he did not send me for Lewis—I saw Sheridan most days from the time of my coming to town, till taking out the summons—after I left my father's, I went to my uncle's—Sheridan did not stay with me—in Wolverhampton I represented Sheridan as my husband—I never employed him to write for me; I can write—the paper now shown me is Sheridan's writing, he wrote it of his own account—the three papers now shown me are my writing."—Re<lb/>examined: "I never had any connection with Sheridan—I left my father's in Sept. because I was pregnant, to hide my shame—I took with me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., my savings—Sheridan did not go with me, I met with him down at Liverpool—I went by the name of Sheridan at Wolverhampton, because I did not want my father to know but what I was married.")—Jane Lewis was examined as a witness for her—witnesses were examined on the part of the then defendant, and the summons was dismissed, and Parkers and Lewis were charged with perjury.</p>

               <p>that or any other night—the Rookery is half a mile from my house—I know the Cat public-house, but have never been in it—it is a very short distance from my house—when I came home from the hunt I was not with any friends—I rode with the huntsman as far as the kennels—I ride or hunt two or three times a week—I do not recollect that I had been accompanied home by any young men—the last day in Jan. the hounds killed a fox, near Hyde—Hyde may have been a meeting-place that day—I do not know—I was out with the hounds myself that day—I should think I left the hunt about three or four that day—I went straight borne, with a groom behind me—I had friends staying with me now and then in Jan. and Feb.—I had an uncle there, but no young friend—a good many friends of mine joined that hunt.</p>

I have not seen you these two or three months"—a younger brother of hers went with us, and Philip Smith,-and a young lass from Kimber; it was not Jane Lewis—the prisoner paid for the expenses of the party—there was some joking about her and Philip Smith on the road and at the Horse-shoe—I drove them to Brierly-hill, about seven miles from Enville—we went about five miles—we left the young lass there, and brought the others back—the joking took place at the Horse-shoe, at Stowersby, coming back; it was about the wedding between the prisoner and Philip Smith—from what I could see, he was paying his addresses to her; and I said, "I hope when the wedding takes place you will give me the order"—Parkes said it would not be long, and when it was I was to have the order.</p>

On 26th Jan., about half-past six or twenty minutes to seven o'clock, the prisoner came to my house with a man named Sheridan, and two children, a little boy three or four years old, and another six or seven weeks old—they appeared as if they had come from the country—I never beard any one call her Mrs. Sheridan—there was nobody else with them that night—they occupied one room.</p>

I belong to the police station at Ellesmere, in Shropshire—I do not know how far that is from Enville—I know Jane Lewis; she was residing at Ellesmere at the beginning of 1850—I first saw her there some time about the latter end of Jan., or the beginning of Feb. On 27th Feb., 1850, I posted a summons which she had obtained against a man named Bowen, charging him with being the father of a child of which she had been just delivered—she was frequently with me about it—Bowen was in the police—I believe I told her either on 27th or 28th Feb., at Ellesmere, that I had posted the summons to Bowen—I did not see her after that till the March assizes at Shrewsbury.</p>

               <p>I am not sure which—I saw all the prisoners there except Wallis—the man put the box down, and some of the women rushed out of the room to speak to him, and Mrs. Fisgary <hi rend="italic">hushed.</hi> them—the man was beginning to speak to one of the girls, and Mrs. Fisgary told her to hold her tongue—the man left the box, and went away—there was in my box a black silk visite, two cashmere dresses, four night-shifts, a satin bonnet, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, and a variety of small articles not worth men<lb/>tioning—Mrs. Fisgary told me to come into the house and make myself comfortable, and asked whether I wanted anything out; I told her I did not, it being early in the day—it was about half-past three o'clock when I arrived at her house—there was a looking-glass and a black brooch in my box—I wanted to go to a register-office, and I asked Mrs. Fisgary for a card of her house; she said she had not a card, but she would send one of her wenches with me, and she sent Kelly—I left my box in charge of Mrs. Fisgary—she said, "Make yourself comfortable; I will take care of you and the things"—I asked Kelly if she knew where the register-office was; she said she did well—we were a couple of hours walking, and she left me at the Paddington Railway-station—I spoke to a policeman near the station—I thought I would find where the house was, and I could not—I saw an Irishwoman, and I spoke to her—I at last got to the police-station without finding the house—I have been to the house since; I did not find my box there—this is my brooch and looking-glass, and veil (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)—they were in the box when it was left at Mrs. Fis<lb/>gary's—I am sure that the house to which I was afterwards taken by the policeman, was the house I left my box at.</p>

               <p>of the persons—I never learned French—I did not pass through London to go there; I went to Jersey—I do not know whether "Paris" is written on this looking-glass—I know what is inside it—I do not know what else is on it; it was not such an ornament as I took much notice of—I bought it at a hardware-shop in Cork—I do not know the name of the people—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—this brooch is mine—I got it from a young woman who is now in America; her name is Riley—I have no doubt about this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has it ever happened to you to lose a box before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in March, 1850—I charged somebody before the Lord Mayor with having stolen a box and all that it contained—I bad just come from Cork then—I landed, and some man carried my box, and went away with it—I never saw the man again, and I never will, I dare say—the result of it was, they considered I might be mistaken in the person, and he was dis<lb/>charged—I do not know whether a man swore that I was in a public-house at the very time that I said I lost my box—he might have said that unknown to me—the matter was dismissed—the Lord Mayor asked me if I wanted a situation, and he gave me assistance; but he did not give me assistance till I got to Cork—I suppose he thought I was a fool—somebody was sent to the steam-boat, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to the stewardess to give me when I got to Cork—that was in consequence of my destitute situation—I have been here every day since last Monday—I went into some office here—I was asked by one of the gentlemen whether I had ever been in London before, and I denied it; but I was not sworn then.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not Mary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is all alike, Sir, it is like Elisabeth, Betty, and Bess—there are four names in Mary, as well as in that—I was christened Maria—when I was among gentlepeople they called me Mary—I have a mother, she is in the county of Cork—I left Cork with the intention of remaining in London—I did not think of returning back again soon.</p>

I went with Mr. Jury to Mr. Hyam's, in Well-street, Mile-end New<lb/>town—there were twenty-three taps; Mr. Jury identified twenty-two of them—I afterwards went to Mr. Jones's, and this pump laid in his window—we went into the shop, and shortly afterwards Mr. Jones came in, and he and Mr. Jury had some conversation—Mr. Jury pointed to these sixteen half-round bits that were hanging up in the shop—we then went to the prisoner's—it was about one o'clock—as we were going into the shop, Mr. Jury pointed out this brass cock—we went inside—the prisoner was behind the counter—Mr. Jury asked him if he had bought any taps; he said, "No"—he asked if he had got any; he said, "No"—he asked if he had sold any; he said, "No"—he asked if he had sold any cast-steel half-round bits; be said, "No"—he asked if he had bought the brass of a force-pump; he said, "No"—at that moment Mr. Jones came into the prisoner's shop—(we had told him to come in after we had been in a few minutes)—the prisoner then said he recol<lb/>lected selling the brass and iron of a pump to Mr. Jones—I then asked him if he had sold any taps to a Jew; he said, "Yes," he did on Saturday night last—I asked how many; and to the best of my belief, he said "Fifty or sixty"—I asked if he had got an account in his book of purchasing these things; he said, "Yes" he had, and he produced his book, with two entries in it—here is "Mr. Sheldrick, 6, Chicksand-street; 32lbs. of pot-metal, at 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Jan. the 6th;" and on 14th Jan., "Mr. Sheldrick, No. 18, Chicksand-street, 21lbs. of pot-metal, at 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound"—I</p>

               <p>he said the captain had sent to him so many times, he had bought them—he said, "Are you not going to stand the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that you promised last night?"—the prisoner said, "I have not a right to pay the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now, as you did not have them last night"—I then told the prisoner as the pigs were sold I should go home—he asked me to go into a public-house, which I did, and the butcher called for a quartern of gin, which we all partook of—another person then came in and called for a half-pint of old ale and some brandy; and while we were talking, the butcher proposed that we should have some mutton-chops; I said I did not want any, but he said I should have some—I said I wanted to get home, but the butcher said, "As you have had the trouble of coming over here, I will stand some"—thought that we were going to a room, but instead of that, they hurried me back into the skittle-ground; and there the butcher and the other man, who had called for the old ale and brandy, began to play—the prisoner after speaking to them went away out of the skittle-ground, and another party came directly into the skittle-ground, and he betted the butcher and the other man 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he played (the prisoner was not there then)—he won that, and then he betted a sovereign—the person who came in last then came to me and said, "I want a sovereign of you"—I told him I did not want anything to do with it—he said, "You had better give me a sovereign to play with"—I told him I would not have anything to do with it—at that time I was almost helpless from the things they had given me, the spirits and things that they had brought in, and I had had some drink at the bar—I was almost helpless; I was sensible; but I had no more power over myself than nothing—I did not bet, but the last man that came in took the sovereign from me to bet with the others—I do not know how I came to give him the sovereign—he was determined to have it from me whether or no—he then betted him again two sovereigns—he said he wanted two sovereigns of me to put with it—he got them from me—he then betted him four sovereigns, and he came to me for that—I told him I had not got any more money, and then he and the butcher came up and said, "You hare got more money," and they compelled me to put my hand into my pocket, and I pulled out another sovereign; then the butcher put his hand into my pocket, and said, "You have got more money," and the other man forced me to pull it from my pocket—he got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from me after the sovereign—he gave the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the butcher—the butcher then put his hand outside my pocket, and he said, "D—n you, you have got more money;" and he made me surrender it to him—that was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner was not there then—the butcher came to me again, and said, "D—d if you have not got more money now," and he felt my pockets—I said, "It is only my keys," and I pulled them out—he then put his hand into my pocket, and said, "D—n me, you have got more," and he made me surrender some 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-<hi rend="italic">bits</hi> and other silver—they fished out 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—I did not get rid of every farthing I had before the prisoner came back—they took it from me—when the prisoner came back he brought two glasses of spirits, and said, "Drink away, lads"—he then turned round and laughed at me, and said, "What have they been doing?"—I said, "You know what they have been doing; robbed me of every farthing what am I to do?—he said, "The best way for you to do is, I will pay for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and you go home and get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more"—I said I could not do that—he said, "Give me an I O U for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get it back?"—he got a piece of paper from the</p>

               <p>and in consequence of an arrangement with Mr. Garret, I paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for quiet possession, without any disturbance, as Mary Ann Stanford was the only one who had any sort of interest—Edward and Henry were there, and Mr. Garret ordered them out—they walked out, I walked in for a little while, and Mr. Garret gave me formal possession—I then went home—on the 10th, at four o'clock, I went again, for the purpose of meeting some one to whom I wished to let the premises, and found a large mob round the windows, extending half across the street—the shutters were down, and the house, garden and yard were literally full of people—I asked Edwin Stanford, who I found behind the counter, what all this was about, and he said he had taken possession for his brother, and meant to keep it—there were a great many people in the bakehouse—there were two coal-porters, who I noticed particularly, with fantail hats—I asked them what they did there, and they said, they were invited there by Mr. Robert Stanford, and they meant to have a good <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—there were twenty or thirty people in the house, who had principally got sticks in their hands—they were all <hi rend="italic">larking</hi>—there was no drinking till about six—I saw a good deal of beer come in—there was smoking, quarrelling, and fighting—I saw all the defendants there in the course of the evening—I called a policeman, and asked him to take Edwin in cus<lb/>tody—he said he could not unless he came outside the door, and he saw the peace broken—they were singing up to one in the morning, when they could not get any more beer—when I left there then were four or five there—I asked them to go, and they laughed at me—before I put in the distress, the three defendants, another brother, and Mr. Garret were there, and Mr. Garret said, "I am executor, but I shall not act; here are the sons, I shall not administer"—I asked Robert if he was in a position to take his father's business, as I only wanted the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent which was owing, and he said he most decline as he had no money—I offered it to the two others, and they each declined—I then told the broker to take an account of the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Wellington-street, Woolwich. On 28th Feb., between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner, and another boy about his age, came to my shop—one of them (I can hardly tell which) produced to me this mustard-spoon, and asked me if it was silver, and whether I would buy it—I asked where they got it, and one of them said he picked it up in the dust-hole—I asked where they lived, and I said, "You had better go and fetch your parents, and then I will see about it"—they said they lived in the Cottages, which are places built for the soldiers, and they gave me a number; I think it was 24—I said, "I will detain the spoon till you bring your parents"—this is the spoon—they left it, and went away—in about ten minutes they came back, and the other boy said he must have the spoon back; and if not, be would call a constable, if I did not choose to give it up—I took hold of his shoulder, and said, "Come to the constable, we will see; I think you have stolen this spoon, unless you will bring your parents"—he said, "Leave me alone; I am not the thief, this is the thief," pointing to the prisoner—I did not hear the prisoner say anything—I let the other go, and they went away—I then called the policeman.</p>

I know the prisoner well—on that Saturday night, or Sunday morning, I was sitting up for my husband, and the prisoner knocked, seeing a light—it was past twelve o'clock; I thought it was my husband, and opened the door—I inquired after his brother Henry, and he remained about three-quarters of an hour, as near as I can recollect—I dare say it was half-past twelve when he came; he was quite alone—it was one, or past, when he left—I do not recollect—I read of this in the paper on the following Tuesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Rochester—I am master of a barge belonging to Mr. Horsnaill. On 22nd Jan. I was delivering mangold-wurtzel and Swede turnips at White Hart Dock—the prisoner came to me there and said he should like to have some—I told him they were sold, but we were going down to load again, and I would bring him up a fresh load—he gave me his direction to give to my master, and I said, if my owner consented, he should have some—I saw him write it—this is it—I gave it to my master—I afterwards got a cargo of Swede turnips and mangold-wurtzel—I brought them to Horse-Ferry Dock on Saturday, 1st Feb.—when I got there I saw my owner and the prisoner talking together on the wharf—Mr. Horsnaill beckoned me to come on shore, and he said this man was going to sell the cargo, and I was to receive the money—when any carts came down to receive the cargo from the barge's side I was to receive the money before the carts left—the prisoner agreed to that—he said if it was a large cow-keeper came, it would not do to ask him to pay, but if it was one or two persons came he might do so—Mr. Horsnaill said if the whole money was paid afterwards it might go, and I was to go with him to receive the money—on the following Monday morning the prisoner was there again—I asked him whether he had sold the mangold-wurtzel and turnips—be said he had sold the half of them, which was about twenty, or twenty-four, or twenty-five tons, to Mr. Bowran, for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the ton, and 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the Swedes—there came a wagon and two carts with Mr. Bowran's name on them, and in the afternoon some of Mr. Biggs' carts or wagons came—the prisoner told me he had sold them all, and Mr. Biggs was going to have part of them; that was the reason Mr. Biggs' carts came—the cargo altogether was forty-eight tons; and in the coarse of Monday and Tuesday the whole was delivered out, but seven tons to the carts of Bowran and Biggs—on the Tuesday evening the prisoner came again and said they should not be long in clearing the rest out, and he would clean himself and go with me to get the money—he went away, and I did not see him again—the seven tons were fetched away in the morning by Mr. Bowran's cart, but the prisoner was not there—I after<lb/>wards went with Mr. Horsnaill to Mr. Bowran's, and we afterwards met the prisoner—Mr. Horsnaill asked him when he was going to settle—he said, "I will settle with you directly"—he went a little way with us, and then he wanted to turn back to go to his wife—we went with him—he asked us to go into a public-house—we went inside a public-house door, and he went out and went over to his own door, which was right opposite—we waited outside—he did not come out, and I did not see him any more till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 98.) I saw the three prisoners in Battersea-fields on 6th Feb., about half-past nine o'clock in the morning—they were together—I was in plain clothes, and I watched them—I saw them all go into two public-houses, and Ellington and Feary went into five shops—Stringer staid outside, watching—they afterwards went to Mr. Bellchambers', and I saw Feary go to his shop three times, and Ellington and Stringer stopped on the opposite side of the way—the third time, Feary made a pull at the coat which was hanging at the shop-door—he did not get it—he went back to his companions after touching it—he saw me watching him, and I went into Mr. Bass's, a builder, about fifty yards from Mr. Bedchambers'—Mr. Bass went up-stairs, and looked out of his window—he came down-stairs a few minutes afterwards, and told me something—in consequence of that, I went towards Wandsworth, and when I got to the Railway arch, the prisoners were there—they were stopped by Mr. Bass, and given into my charge—with Mr. Bass's assist<lb/>ance, I took them to Mr. Bellchambers' shop, and then went to find the property—the witness, Skinner, pointed out to me a heap of bricks, which was close to the road where I had followed the prisoners—I found this cap under the stack of bricks—I received this coat from Mr. Bellchambers' shopman.</p>

Walker came to my house, and I went up-stairs—I looked out, and saw the three prisoners—Stringer and Elling<lb/>ton were on the opposite side, a little distance beyond Mr. Bellchambers' shop, and Feary was nearer to my house on the same side—it was between one and two o'clock in the day—I saw Feary walk to the other two pri<lb/>soners, and then he went across to Mr. Bellchambers' shop, and then back to the others, then back to the shop, then back to the others, and then to the shop again, and the third time he went in a hurried manner, and made an attempt at something, I could not see what it was—the moment he grasped it, the other two walked off, and Feary ran after them towards Wandsworth—I went down, and gave information to Walker—I then went out of my back-door across the gardens under the Richmond Railway, and saw the prisoners close to the main arch—I came behind them, and caught them—they saw me just as I came up, and one of them, I think Feary, said, "Let us <hi rend="italic">cut</hi>"—one of the others made answer, "No, d—n it, let us stand our ground"—I then beckoned Walker to come on—he came, and they were taken.</p>

On 6th Feb., I heard a noise outside the shop-window—I went out, and missed a coat and a cap from the front of the door-post—the cap was fastened to the coat—I had seen them safe a few minutes before—I found the coat in a meadow adjoining the shop, by the side of the road going towards Wandsworth—there are wooden pales by the side, and it was three or four yards from the pales—this is the coat and cap—I know the cap, because it is exactly like the one I lost, and what I have got—I had not sold a cap that day at all like it.</p>
