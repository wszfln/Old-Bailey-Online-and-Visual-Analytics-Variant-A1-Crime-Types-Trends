                  </hi>, 722a, Old Kent Road, newsagent. On Novem<lb/>ber 9, at about 9 p.m., Dempsey came into my shop and bought a pennyworth of Nosegay tobacco and 1/2 d. book of cigarette papers, for which he tendered counterfeit half-crown (Exhibit 1) and received 2s. 4 1/2 d. change. He then went out. Shortly afterwards my husband returned to the shop, saw the half-crown, went out, and returned with both prisoners in custody. I pointed out Dempsey as being the man who had passed the half-crown; turning to Hyde, Dempsey said, "You gave me the half-crown." He also said he had been changing money all day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Dempsey. A young lady from "The Kentish Drovers" public-house made a communication to me that men were changing counterfeit coin; I do not know why she is not a witness.</p>

                  </hi>, husband of last witness. On Novem<lb/>ber 9, shortly after 9 p.m., I came into my shop and was shown counterfeit half-crown (Exhibit 1). I went out and saw Dempsey, about 20 yards off, joining Hyde, who was on the other side of the road. As he crossed the road Dempsey shook hands with himself. I think one of the prisoners said, "I told you so." They then walked on. I spoke to a police-constable and they were arrested. In their presence I told the police-constable they had been in my place and changed a bad half-crown. Dempsey said he had not changed any money at all, nor had he been in my shop. Hyde said, "I cannot say if I changed it or not; I have changed a lot of half-crowns to-day." On the way back to the shop I heard some money drop; it appeared to drop from Hyde. At the shop my wife identified the man who had given her the half-crown. I handed the coin to the police-constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Hyde. I did not say at the police court that you said, "I do not know whether I changed it or not; I have changed a lot of half-crowns to-day"; I was not asked. I have thought of it since.</p>
               <p>To Dempsey. I was not in the shop when you tendered the coin; a young lady called me in and told me what had happened. I do not know her name and address. I did not consider it my duty to secure</p>

               <p>her attendance here as a witness. When I heard money drop I did not say anything.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR BURCHELL</hi>, 768 P. On November 9, at about 9.15 p.m., Adams called my attention to the two prisoners whom I then arrested. In the presence of the prisoners Adams said, "These two men are passing bad money down the road; they passed one over the counter to my Missis"; he then handed me counterfeit half-crown (produced). Dempsey said, "This is a very unlucky tangle for me"; and said he wished he had never met the other prisoner. Hyde said nothing. I searched them and found 1s. 9 1/2 d. on Dempsey; nothing on Hyde. I took them to Adams's shop, where they were identified by Mrs. Adams. Dempsey then said, "That is quite right, governor; he (referring to Hyde) gave me the half-crown to come in for a pennyworth of Nosegay and a halfpennyworth of cigarette papers." Hyde said, "That is quite right."</p>
               <p>To Dempsey. You said, "It is an unlucky tangle for me" at the police station after you were charged; you did not say it when I arrested you. I found 1s. 9 1/2 d. on you—not on Hyde. (The deposi<lb/>tion was read, showing that witness to have said at the police court, in answer to cross-examination by Hyde, "You had only 1s. 9d. in money on you.")</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN BISSELL</hi>, P division. On November 9, at abort 9.30 p.m., I was called to Adams's shop, where I found prisoners in custody. Mrs. Adams said, "This man (Dempsey) a little while ago came into the shop and called for a pennyworth of Nosegay and a halfpenny packet of A.G. cigarette papers and tendered this coin; gave him the goods and 2s. 4d. change." Dempsey said, "He" (Hyde) "gave me the half-crown to get a pennyworth of tobacco and a packet of cigarette papers, which I got and gave him the change." Hyde said, "That is right." I sent for a barman at "The Kentish Drovers" public-house, who said, in the presence of the prisoners, "Both these men came into the four-ale bar and that man" (Hyde) "called for two shandy ales; I drew them; he gave me a half-crown which, on testing by rubbing it on the till, I found was a bad one. I handed him the coin back, told him it was a bad one, and took the beer away from them. Both the men left the bar together." I told pri<lb/>soners they would be taken to the station and charged with uttering counterfeit coin. Dempsey made no reply; Hyde said, "You have made a bloomer this time." They were taken to the station and charged. Neither made any reply to the charge; afterwards Dempsey said to me, "It is an unlucky tangle for me; I am sorry I ever met him." I searched both prisoners at the police station. On Dempsey I found a broken packet of Nosegay, cigarette papers, and two packets of A.G. cigarette papers, one quite new and the other partly used, and a small tin box containing loose tobacco. On Hyde I found 1s. 6d. silver and 3d. bronze.</p>

                  </hi>, principal accountant, Bank Notes Department, Bank of England. I am the custodian of the cancelled notes. The £5 note (Exhibit 106) No. 60,649 was issued from the Bank on November 9, 1911, and returned on December 5, 1911. It is en<lb/>dorsed, "J. Robertson, 3, Morley Road, Chiswick." Exhibit 11 is a photographic negative of that same note. I have examined two bundles of notes (Exhibits 4 and 21); they are forgeries of £10 notes. In each bundle some of the notes are incomplete; the cypher, the letter K, is missing. There are 86 complete in Exhibit 4 and six com<lb/>plete in Exhibit 21, except for the letter "K." Those notes seem to have been printed from the copper plate (Exhibit 5). The letter "K" is also missing from the copper plate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Browne. The cypher was missing from all the notes I have seen. To my knowledge no forged notes of that de<lb/>scription have come into the bank.</p>

                  </hi>, photographic engraver. I am employed as a demonstrator to Messrs. Penrose at 109, Farringdon Street. I know all the prisoners. Browne and Byrne came to Penrose's pre<lb/>mises about October last year. They said they wanted to reproduce maps and plans or drawings of that description. They asked for some instruction. I arranged that they should come up to my workshop at the Polytechnic (where I am demonstrator in photographic engrav<lb/>ing) and I gave them some instruction later on. I think Browne and Byrne came about three times. Browne came altogether six or seven times. They came afterwards with Wallace, whom they intro<lb/>duced to me as their electrical engineer. Wallace came to see the lamp I was using and which I explained to him; I think he came about three times. The instruction extended over five or six weeks. Watts came last of all. He said be came from "Robinson" and he wanted me to help him in the work in which I had instructed Browne and Byrne. He said he was a printer and wanted instruction in lithographic printing. I think he cane to me twice. I gave him the formula (Exhibit 82). In November last I went to Hammersmith Police Station and there picked out Browne and Watts. I saw Byrne there, but I was uncertain of him. I recognised him afterwards, when he was in the dock at the court. When he was at my work<lb/>shop he was wearing glasses; he was not wearing glasses when I went to identify him. His general appearance when I first met him was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010012"/>
               <p>that of a man fairly well to do and he was shaven. When I went to identify him he had a growth of about a fortnight on his chin and generally looked a man down at heel. The paper of the notes (Ex<lb/>hibite 4 and 21) is darker than normal; it looks dirty. The paper can be bleached and made perfectly white by chemical process. I am not acquainted with the class of paper called cream wove bank paper.</p>
               <p>I think a solution of sulphuric acid of sufficient strength will parch<lb/>mentise paper, make it tough and leathery. The notes produced look as though they have been parchmentised. The formula in pocket book (Exhibit 98) would not be of sufficient strength to parchmentise; it might be used in batteries. The photographic negative (Exhibit 11) might be used for reproducing a £5 note. Exhibit 10 appears to be ft negative of a line drawing. There is" £10" on it and a number of wavy lines. Exhibit 19 is a zinc plate taken from the negative. I do not know of any process for producing the appearance of a water mark by means of a sine plate. Exhibit 6 is a zinc plate similar to No. 19, except that it has" £5" instead of" £10."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Browne. The sine plate might have been taken from the negative. On the negative there is the number 81,611. I cannot see any number on the zinc plate; there it something there in the place where the number is on the negative. Nothing I showed you had anything to do with copper plate printing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Valetta. I first saw Browne about the middle of October last. I saw Byrne at the police court and failed to identify him. he had no glasses on then and his general appearance was so different. I do not remember Browne spoke when they first came to me; they were both together. I did not know Byrne's name at all, or Browne's name. Byrne took no lesson at all, he simply watched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bennett. When Browne first came to me he said he wanted to reproduce maps and plans. I failed to identify Watts at the police station. I saw Watts twice, some time after I saw the others; he said he came from "Robinson." Exhibit 82 is a formula for sensitising metal. I believe I gave that to Wallace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Wallace. I have not heard it said that electri<lb/>cal knowledge is required for the purpose of carrying out these for<lb/>geries; the only electrical part is the lighting for the printing; it is quite possible to do without electric light if the daylight is strong enough.</p>

Wallace helped him move in on December 9, 1911. He asked me to help him move the things up, and he told me to be careful because there was an electric battery there. Browne was there three or four months. Byrne came there frequently. I only saw Wallace once after they moved in. I never saw Watts to my knowledge. Browne moved out about April 7 and 8. He left behind various bottles and jars. One had cyanide of potassium in it, and there were other chemicals.</p>

                  </hi>, of Chesterton and Sons, house agents. At the beginning of August, 1912, Browne applied for the letting of flat No. 4, in Warwick Chambers, Pater Street, off Earl's Court Road. He gave the name of James Robertson, of 2, Charon Road, Chiswick. I wrote to the references that he gave and Exhibit 104 is one of the replies I got. It is addressed from 30, Hanforth Road, and dated August 22,1912, signed "G. Wallace." I let the flat to Browne and be moved in on August 26. On September 30 he changed that flat for flat No. 2; he remained there till the date of his arrest. He changed the lock of the door and put his own Yale lock on.</p>
               <p>To Browne. I had some correspondence with you about the look on the door. You told me you had a lock of your own and you put it on. I do not think there is anything extraordinary in that.</p>

Browne purchased a lithographic press and two stones, and the invoice was made out to him in the name of Robertson. He paid £2 on account. The goods were delivered to Ravenscourt Perk Mansions. The total amount was £6 7s. Nothing has been paid beyond the £2. I made many applications, and the letters came back marked "unknown" In October Watts rang me up on the phone about purchasing a copper-plate press for a friend. I told him it would have to be a cash transaction, as I had not been paid for the other. I heard nothing more of that. Afterwards, when I saw Watts, I asked him for Robinson's address, and he said he had finished printing for Robinson and did not know where he was then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am works manager to Mark Reeves, Limited, printers; I was formerly overseer of the machinery depart<lb/>ment. In that capacity I worked under prisoner Watts. Watts intro<lb/>duced Browne to me. Browne produced a bottle and told me that it was ammonia and we spoke of producing a watermark on a mining plan; it was given to me to be a kind of foreshore and I was to assist in the interest of the firm. Watts first spoke of the watermark; he told me he had a friend a mining engineer and he was drawing plane and be wanted to produce a watermark at the bottom of the plans to imitate or represent a foreshore. This was before the introduction of Browne. Exhibits 6 and 19 would not be called in the printing trade zincos. Watts brought a since which had a half-tone etching on it, what is known as a half-tone block. I said to him, "Take that off; the acid will bite it away." I meant the ammonia which was in a little bottle. We saturated a piece of paper with ammonia, laid it on the press, and put the zinco on top of it; the result was to all intents and purposes a watermark. I only demonstrated that once. I heard no more about it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Curtis Bennett. Watts told me that somebody wanted to put watermarks on mining plans to represent a foreshore. After that Browne was introduced to me and some tests were made. The test took place in the composing-room of my firm; there was nothing private about it.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED SAUNDEBS</hi>, E division. I received in<lb/>structions form Inspector Gough to keep watch upon Warwick Cham<lb/>bers I began to keep observation there in the afternoon of Monday, October 28. I saw Watte at 8.15 p.m. leave Warwick Chambers and visit "The Princess Victoria public-house at the corner of Pater Street and Earl's Court Road. He returned and left again at 8.45 pm. He saw me standing in a doorway talking to my inspector; he pawed us twice and then came back into the doorway.</p>
               <p>I was standing alone and said, "It is raining, isn't I said, "Yes, just a bit." We had other conversation about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010016"/>
               <p>the weather and I left the doorway and went up Earls Court Road I turned back and followed him and saw him enter 2, Warwick Chambers. I again kept observation on October 30. I saw Byrne and another man not in custody enter 2, Warwick Chambers, at 9.20 A.m.; they left at 9.50 a.m., walked to "The Adam and Eve "public-house, High Street, Kensington. They parted outside the house and Byrne returned to 2, Warwick Chambers, about 10.15 a.m.; he left at 11.20, walked to High Street, Kensington, and there hailed a taxi-cab and drove away in the direction of Hammersmith.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Valetta. I said at the police court it was on the 29th. I have since had an opportunity of examining my diary and I find I made a mistake. I saw Byrne on the early morning of October 30. I saw him enter 2, Warwick Chambers, at 9.20. 2, Warwick Cham<lb/>ben, is about 15 yards down from Earl's Court Road. I was standing by the corner shop at the corner of Earl's Court Road and Pater Street, the opposite to Warwick Chambers. I saw Byrne go in the entrance; I crossed the road and went into Warwick Chambers; I could not see him in the passage; he did not go into No. 3 or I should have seen him; I was pretty close behind him. I could have seen him had he gone upstairs. I did not wait for him to come out; I left immediately I was satisfied he was not in the passage. I did not see Byrne till he left at 9.50. I do not think he came away within a quarter of an hour or I should have seen him. Byrne came out and went and had a drink and then returned. I saw him go in the passage and I left. He went in at 10.15 and came out at 11.20. The times I have given are correct. I did not see him during that time and I did not go away. I did not say at the police court that I watched there two consecutive days. I said I saw Watts on the evening of the 29th. I did not watch two consecutive days.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Curtis Bennett. I did not see Watts on the 29th; it was the 28th.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">PERCY ATTERSOLL</hi>, 266, E division, proved a plat of the flats at Warwick Chambers.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES MCLEAN</hi> produced photographs of the same premises, taken by Sergeant Boustread.</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GOUGH</hi>, E Division. I gave instruc<lb/>tions to Sergeant Saunders to keep observation upon Warwick Chambers. I visited him on the 28th to see that he was watching. While I was there I saw a man come out of Warwick Chambers and come towards where I was standing with my umbrella up; it was raining hard, Saunders was behind me. I passed down Earl's Court Road' and kept a fair distance away. I afterwards saw Saunders and from what he told me I decided to abandon the observation for that night. On October 30 at 1 p.m. I went to No. 2 flat in Warwick Chambers with other officers. The door was opened by prisoner Browne. I told him I was a police-inspector and wanted to make some inquiries. The other officers came in behind me and we went into No. 1 room. I saw a bundle of what appeared to be forged Bank of England notes on the table. Browne said, "You have got it all here."</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010017"/>
               <p>I commenced to search the flat. Browne said, "I am a sport and not one of those to open against other people." I told him I should charge him with manufacturing forged Bank of England notes and that I should take possession of all the notes and other things. He said, "Naturally." In room No. 1 I found Exhibit 4, a parcel of £10 bank notes, 86 complete and three incomplete; Exhibit 5, a copper plate engraving from a £10 note, with the serial letter K and the vignette missing; Exhibit 6, a zinc plate with the mark of" £5" on it and other marks, Exhibit 7, a tin box containing paper out to the six of a bank note; Exhibit 9, a drawing of a £5 note on tracing paper; Exhibit 10, a photographic negative plate of a £10 note; Exhibit 11, a negative of a £5 note; Exhibit 14, a printing frame with a sine plate in it showing the watermarking of a £10 note; Exhibit 15, a bag containing type; Exhibit 15a, a vignette of Britannia upon a metal block; Exhibit 16, a quantity of blotting-paper (some of the 89 notes I found were being dried between blotting-paper similar to this). I also found Exhibit 74, a cheque on the L.C. and M. Bank, Holland Park Branch, for £3, drawn by Byrne on September 6, 1912, in favour of J. Robinson and endorsed "J. Robinson"; Exhibit 75, letter dated August 25 from 193, Felsham Road, Putney, signed by Byrne, beginning "Dear Jim" (Browne); Exhibit 76, a similar letter dated October 25; Exhibit 77, an envelope containing Braddick's name and address; Exhibit 80, Spicer's account for paper; Exhibit 81, Hewitt's account for lithographic press; Exhibit 82, the formula identified by Lawes. In room 3 I found ten books relating to photography and photographic printing. In room 3 I found the printing press, Exhibit 18; in between the rollers of the press I found the zinc plate, Exhibit 19; on the platen I found Exhibit 20, a £10 note. On a table I found 16 £10 notes (Exhibit 21) in an acid bath and eight £10 notes (Exhibit 122) between sheets of blotting-paper; also Exhibit 24, a tin plate with printer's ink on it; Exhibit 25, a printer's ink roller; Exhibit 26, a printer's knife; Exhibit 27, a flat iron; Exhibit 29, a zinc plate with some design on it, nothing to do with a bank note; Exhibit 30, blotting-paper; Exhibit 31, a large bottle of ammonia and other bottles of chemicals. In room 4 I found Exhibit 51, an arc lamp; Exhibits 58 land 59, two lithographic stones, and some chemicals, Exhibits 60, 62, 63,65, 67, and 68.</p>
               <p>(Thursday, December 5.)</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GOUGH</hi>, recalled, further examined. Oc<lb/>tober 31 I went to 23, Garlick Hall, the address of Watts's em<lb/>ployers, and there saw him. I told him he would be arrested for being concerned with Browne in the manufacture of forged notes. At his request we went to the office of the managing director. Watts said to him, "Duncan Browne asked me where he could obtain a press about a fortnight ago; I took him to Mr. Braddick, and he paid £2 10s. for the press; he had it delivered to 2, Warwick Chambers; that is all I have to say. I am not interested in it in any shape or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010018"/>
               <p>form." I took him to Nothing Hill police station, where he was charged. I found on him two cheques (Exhibit's 89 and 90) drawn by Henry J. Watts upon Cox's; they had not gone through any bank; also this key, Exhibit 73. I tried that on the lock of No. 2, Warwick Chambers, and found it opened the door; it is identical with the key I found on Browne; they are Yale keys. On Watts I also found Ex<lb/>hibit 88, the agreement with Braddick; also Exhibit 91, a piece of paper with the address, "2, Warwick Chambers," in Watte's hand-writing. Amongst the papers at 2, Warwick Chambers, I found this slip of paper (Exhibit 125), containing the address 69, Austin Road, Carford, which is Watts's private address, in Watts's writing; also Exhibit 126, a note in Browne's writing, containing the words "Penrose, 109, Farringdon Road." A card (Exhibit 127), "Wallace and Co., electrical engineers, dealers and job buyers of electrical goods, 48, Old Compton Street W."; that is an accommodation address where letters may be received; a telegram to "Roberts, 2, Warwick Chambers," dated October 27, "Meet me Mansion House Station, two o'clock, Watts" (the original was produced by a Post Office official and identified as in Watt's handwriting); also Exhibit 131, a formula very similar to that spoken of by Lawes, in the handwriting of Browne Exhibit 109 was written in my presence by Wallace. In Exhibit 96 the address, "W. Byrne, Esq., 193, Felsham Road," is in Browne's writing; the message on the card, "Dear B&amp;.1, we shall both be at Hammersmith Tube Station at 10.45 to-morrow, Tuesday, George," is in Wallace's writing; the other words on the card, "Dear Bill, I had some business with George, so could not meet you; I will be at Hammersmith Tube 10.45, Tuesday; always yours, Jim," are in Browne's writing. Exhibit 104 (see Lord's evidence) it in Wallace's writing. Exhibit 110 was written by Browne in my presence; he signed it "D. Browne" and also "J. Roberts." Exhibit 97, a letter card of October 12, addressed to Byrne, and signed "Jim," is a Browne's writing. Exhibit 74 in cheque for £3, dated September 16, drawn by Byrne and endorsed "J. Robinson"; the endorsement is in Browne's writing. Exhibit 111 was written in my presence by Byrne Exhibit 75 (" Dear Jim, I have seen George to-day, and have seen the proofs; now I am satisfied everything will be all right") is in Byrne's writing; so is Exhibit 76. Upon a £5 note (Exhilbit 106) the endorse<lb/>ment" J. Robisson, 3, Morley Road, Chiswick," is in Browne's writing. Police inquiries have failed to discover any such road in Chiswick. The large batch of £10 notes (Exhibit 4) appear all to have had some attempt made to impress a watermark upon them.</p>
               <p>To Browne. At the time I arrested you I believe you were the only occupant of the flat; I have no knowledge that another man escaped "shortly before we came.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Valetta. I found at Warwick Chambers an automatic penny-in-the-slot machine; it appeared as if it had been experimented with. I know that Wallace has taken out patents for various in<lb/>ventions.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010019"/>
               <p>To Wallace. Exhibit 109 is a request by you to the Commissioner of Police to have given up some materials relating to one of your patents.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED SAUNDERS</hi>, recalled. On October 30, at 9.50 a.m., I saw Byrne leave the flat with another man; Morrison brought into court) that was the man.</p>
               <p>To Browne. I followed Byrne and Morrison to the "Adam and Eve." I got back to Warwick Chambers about 10.15, Byrne left alone at 11.20 and I followed him to High Street, Kensington, where he took a taxi. I returned to Warwick Chambers after being away about three minutes and kept observation until the arrest was made.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Valetta. I saw Morrison arrive at the flat at 9.20 that morning.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JOSEPH GILLARD</hi>, E division. On October 30 I went to 193, Felsham Road, Putney, and saw Byrne. I told him he would be arrested on suspicion of being concerned with one Robinson or Robertson, of 2, Pater Street (Warwick Chambers), in making and possessing counterfeit bank notes and counterfeit coin. He said, "I have never been to 2, Pater Street; I do not know a Robinson; but I bad better say nothing." In Byrne's pocket I found this memoran<lb/>dum (Exhibit 1), "G. Wallace, Hanforth Road, Kennington; tube to Oval; change Oxford Circus." I went up with Byrne to the room he occupied; while I was searching he said, "I have not touched any<lb/>thing here for 15 months; I get my money on the Continent; I should have been on the Continent again in a day or two; instead of that I stop here and get pinched." On the way to the station he said, "Robinson could not make lils, leave alone bank notes." "Lils" are flash "Bank of Engraving" notes. Later he said, "Robinson it a clever man; he is a University man and I have known him own over 70 horses; Robinson knows nothing about making bank notes or coun<lb/>terfeit coin; he is not the man who makes them." Exhibits 96, 97, and 98 were found in Byrne's room (98 is a pocket-book containing a formula similar to Exhibit 131). Byrne described himself as a book-maker. I found in his room a race-card for Hurst Park on Septem<lb/>ber 26, 1912 (Exhibit 99); on it is written the address, "22, Warwick Chambers, Pater Street"; besides a betting ticket I found no other evidence of Byrne's connection with betting. On October 31 I went to 30, Hanforth Road, Brixton, and saw Wallace. I told him he would be arrested on suspicion of being concerned with Browne and Byrne; he said, "I had better say nothing." I found there portions of an automatic stamping machine; referring to these, Wallace said he had patents or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Valetta. I am certain that I told Byrne he would be arrested on suspicion of being concerned with "a man named Robin<lb/>son or Robertson"; I did not say, "A man called Robbie."</p>

There is a close resemblance between this vignette and the "Britannia" on a Bank of England note. None of the notes in Exhibit 4 are genuine; they resemble genuine notes; in home the numerals appear to have been filled in by type.</p>

               <p>To Wallace. For three or four weeks in October you were engaged for me in fitting up a shop with electric light, shelves, etc., at 173, Church Road, Barnes. I paid you £27 10s. for the job. I have been in negotiation with Byrne about financing a patent automatic machine of your invention.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Muir. After knocking at the door of 2, Warwick Cham<lb/>bers, I stood talking to Byrne not more than five minutes and then left. It would be at least half-past nine when I got there. It is untrue that I was inside the building for 30 minutes. I was con<lb/>victed in 1911 for frequenting with intent to get money by means of the confidence trick.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a bookmaker, living at 193, Felsham Road, Putney. I have known Browne 30 years, Wallace a few months; Watts I had never seen until these proceed<lb/>ings. I was introduced by Byrne to Wallace and it was through me that Wallace got the job mentioned by Morrison. Wallace spoke to me about his invention of an automatic machine and asked me to finance it; after seeing the machine I agreed, and it was arranged that I was to give Browne a share of the profit. I am 62 years old and in bad health, and my niece often writes for me and fills up cheques. In Exhibit 75 the words "have seen proofs" refer to my having seen the automatic machine and been satisfied about it. All the letters that have been produced and connected with me refer to this machine. I have never in my life been inside 2, Warwick Chambers. On the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010021"/>
               <p>morning of October 30 I went with Morrison to that address to see Browne's machine; we could not get in and left after a few minutes' waiting. After having a drink together Morrison went off to the races and I went back to the Chambers alone; again I could not get in, and I left a note in the letter-box. I have never been in Harden's shop, and do not know where it is. When I was arrested the officer said to me, "You are William Byrne"; I said, "Yes, that's me"; he said, "Robbie is pinched"; I said, "Who is Robbie"; he said, "Of Earl's Court Road; he is pinched for mating £10 notes"; I said, 'I know nothing about Robbie or Earl's Court Road." From first to last I have had nothing to do with any counterfeiting or forging of bank notes at Warwick Chambers.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Muir. About lithography or chemistry I know no more than the man in the moon. I knew Browne as J.D. Robinson. I was in London from September to February last; not continuously; I slip over to Ostend and other places on the Continent for the races. Exhibit 98 is my pocket-book; I cannot Bay in whose handwriting is the formula written there; as to what it means, it seems to me that it is something to do with a medical battery for the nerves. You will see lots of things in the pocket-book, addresses and so on, that are not in my writing. The address on the race-card (Exhibit 99) is in Robinson's writing; on one occasion (I cannot remember when) I asked him whether he had shifted; he said yes, and he gave me this address. I never visited him at that address. Exhibit 97 is-a letter-card to me from Browne, "Harry has to go to Birmingham on our business." That refers to Harry Smith, an engineer; I do not know whether he is here, it does not refer to Watts. It is not correct that when I went to War<lb/>wick Chambers on the morning of October 30 I waited half an hour; Saunders's evidence is quite incorrect. The note I left in the letter-box was just to say that I would see Browne later on, or to that effect; I cannot say why the police did not find this note.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been living at 69, Horstead Road, Catford, for 20 years. I am a printer. From 1888 to 1894 I was deputy-manager to Merritt and Hatcher, Limited. In 1904 I started business for myself with another man as Suffolk and Watts; that business was turned into a company. In 1904 I sold my shares in the company and became manager to Messrs. Noble and Co. Upon that, business failing in 1907 I became a traveller to the North<lb/>ampton Press. In 1910 I became works manager to my present employers, Morgan Reeves and Co. Until these proceedings I have never had any accusation brought against me. I do not know either Byrne or Wallace; I had not seen either until my arrest. I first got to know Browne at the latter end of 1911; he was introduced to me at Mr. Roberts; shortly afterwards he told me his name was Robertson. I was introduced by a Mr. Gray, who was then engaged on one of the London dailies, I think the "Morning Advertiser." He told me Browne was a mining engineer, and might put some printing in my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010022"/>
               <p>way in connection with mining plans and prospectuses. I quoted for some work, but did not get the order. After that I did not see Browne till the beginning of this year. He told me he had some printing to do, some mining plans; it was private work and he wanted to do it himself; he was taking lessons at Messrs. Penrose's and wanted to purchase a press. I introduced him to Hewitt. Hewitt's and Lawes's evidence is correct. The formula I obtained from Lawes. Later on Browne told me he had not been successful with his plates and asked could I assist him. I told him I was only a letterpress printer and referred him to Lawes. As to the vignette, Exhibit 100, that was handed to me by Browne when he asked me to quote for the printing of a patriotic song. As to Windsor, Browne told me he wanted his mining plans printed in two colours with a watermark representing a seashore in front of the land, and I introduced him to Windsor. I had nothing to do with the purchase of the paper. Browne told me he wanted a copper-plate press and I introduced him to Braddick. I have never been in Birmingham; I was not known to Browne as "Harry." I first went to Warwick Chambers on October 19. Browne met me that day and told me he had selected a machine from Braddick's and asked me to come and look at. it: I went and saw the machine; I was there altogether about 20 minutes. I went to the flat next on October 22; Browne had promised me 10s. for the introduction to Braddick and I went to collect it. Directly Browne opened the door he said, "I was just going out"; we walked to Kennington Rail<lb/>way Station, stopped at a public-house and had a drink, and I left him. I did not get the 10s. On the 28th I went to Warwick Chamb rs again on the same errand. It was a very rough night and Browne suggested that instead of going all the way home to Catford I should sleep there; I did so. All this was in room No. 2; I was never in No. 3. As I was-sitting talking to Browne I noticed the two receipts, Exhibits 101 and 102, and that they were in my name; I put them in my pocket I said to Browne, "If you don't complete the purchase of the press Braddicks will come on "me for the balance"; he said that if he did not complete he would return the press. I said, "Have you a spare key of this flat, so that the press can be taken away if you don't complete?" he then gave me the key (Exhibit 73). As to Exhibit 91, on October 18 Browne and I went into the "Cheshire Cheese"; I said to him, "What is your address now?"; he told it me and I wrote it on this piece of paper. I had nothing to do with the forging of notes at this flat, and had no idea that anything of the sort was going on. I have been in continuous employment since 1888, earning over £3 a week.

               <p>1911, when you removed to 54, St. John's Square, Clerkenwell. Graham became a partner about March, 1911; the document you band me is the deed of partnership. I understood that just recently a dis<lb/>solution was arranged, you to retain certain patents and Graham to have the remainder, in October last you had a contract to do some electrical fitting at 173, Church Road, Barnes; through you I and my father were engaged to do some decorating work at the same place. You were at work there daily from daylight till dark from October 3 to October 18; then for another week; I am sure you were there on the 26th. Since you left St. John's Square you have used 48, Old Compton Street, as a business address. About September I did some work for you, altering an old automatic machine; I understood you were going to patent an improved machine. I have new known you otherwise than as an upright and honourable business man. (Cross-examination postponed.)</p>

               <p>printing; I know something of half-tone and three-colour printing, nothing of lithographic printing. At Morgan Reeves and Co.'s I had nothing to with sensitising or developing plates for printing; while with them I devoted my Whole time to their business. I never knew Browne as Duncan Browne; he was first introduced to me as Roberts and he corrected it to Robertson. Before the magistrate I made no explanation, but said that I was innocent and reserved my defence I know that it is criminal to print lottery tickets. I did it on one occa<lb/>sion, using not my own name but that of Wilson. I did it for a German named Baach. I was also in correspondence with two other lottery keepers; I then used the name of Luson. I ceased to have a banking account in 1904. The cheque produced ("Cox and Co., Sep<lb/>tember 12, 1912. Pay Duncan and Co. £7 10s. Harry J. Watts is in my writing. One night I was going in a taxi-cab to the Holborn Restaurant to meet Browne; on the floor of the cab I found a bag which contained, among other things, a cheque-book. I put the cheque-boot in my pocket. Browne kept the bag, saying, "I will find out who the owner is and return it" I admit filling in two cheques from the book. There were papers in the bag which disclosed who the owner was. I much regret that I did not return it. This cheque was found on me when I was arrested; it was very foolish of me to fill it in; it never left my possession and I did not intend to use it; the same applies to the other cheque you hand me (also on Cox's, payable to Chapman and Co., for £8 15s., dated September 18). The reason I took all the trouble I did in getting things for Browne was that he said he could introduce a considerable amount of printing to my firm. Until Byrne mentioned yesterday the name of Harry Smith I never heard of it; I never met him.</p>

Dunton carried a sack, Chidley a brown paper parcel, the third man's pockets were bulky. I fallowed them through Waterloo Road and Oakley Street, when I stopped them; the third man ran away. I said, "What have you got in that sack?" Dunton said, "Nothing," throwing the sack to the ground. It contained a slab and six ingots of metal. I told the two prisoners they would be taken to Kennington Road Police Station. Chidley said, "You have got a fine cop." I took them to Kennington Police Station, where I found the parcel contained sir small ingots. Dunton said, "I will tell you the truth, I got it from</p>

They made no reply. I took them to Bride<lb/>well, where they were formally charged and made no reply. In a cab on the way to the station Dunton, in the presence of Chidley, said, "I have been bringing it out for the last seven weeks.

I lived with my first wife six months, when she deserted me. She kept away about six months, when she came back. I took her in and she lived with me for about a month or six weeks, when she again went away, taking my wages with her. She was very much addicted to drink. I Have not seen my first wife for the past 12 years. She called on me then while I was living in Gurney Street, Walworth, with her daughter's young man, who is now dead. His name was Atkins. He threatened me just for annoyance. I was paying my wife 5s. a week for my youngest daughter's maintenance. I have never seen my wife since that time."</p>

                  </hi>, warehouseman, John Howell and Co., Limited, St. Paul's Churchyard. At 12.50 p.m. on November 19 I was called to the third floor of the warehouse, when I saw prisoner pick up a feather necklet and put it in his right-hand pocket. He walked away and I stopped him. He said to me, "Where is your cloth room?" I pointed to the staircase, and he walked up. I followed him. When we got to the top he sad, "What are you following me for?" I said, "I want you to come down with me to the front door." He said, "I wont come down with you." We walked down the staircase which we had gone up. As he passed the place from where he had picked up the necklet he replaced it. I picked it up and said, "That is what you had in your pocket." We walked to the front door, where I met Mr. Searle. The value of the necklet was 6s. 1ld. Prisoner was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I did not accuse you at first because I wanted to accuse you before a reliable witness; we were alone when you took the necklet.</p>

                  </hi>, warehouseman. On November 19 the last witness brought prisoner to me at the front door; he said he had seen prisoner with the necklet in his pocket. Prisoner gave the address of Edmunds Brothers, Wood Green, and gave me to understand that he was out of employment at that time. I telephoned to that firm, but was unable to get on. I confronted prisoner with a man who had been in the employ of Edmunds and Co. for eight yean; he happened to be in our warehouse; he said he had never seen prisoner before in his life.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT RANT</hi>, 161 B. On November 19 I took prisoner into custody at this warehouse. On the way to the station he made no statement. He tried to get his arm away.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I went into this warehouse with the idea of getting a black satin cloth. I reached the room where the boas were. I stopped and changed my umbrella from one arm to the other. Humble asked me what he could do for me, and I asked him to direct me to the cloth department. He directed me, and as I was going up the stairs he followed me. I asked him whit he was doing so for, and he made no reply. He went away from me, and the next thing I saw of him was at the front door with his arms out. I asked what the meaning of it was and he said to Searle, who was then present,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010031"/>
               <p>that he had seen me put this boa into my pocket. In reply to Searle I said I had been employed by Edmunds Brothers at their Wood Green Branch. The man Scott was unable to identify me, as he was not en<lb/>gaged by the same firm. The last time I worked there was June 30 last year; I produce a memorandum to prove it. (Memorandum, dated June 30, 1911: "If you are free on July 7 come in for a few days.") That was the second time I was employed there. (Prisoner produced two references, one from Homewood, Limited, stating that prisoner had been in their employ during their last summer sale and on a pre<lb/>vious occasion, during which times they had found him honest and satisfactory; and one from Hyam Brothers, Limited, stating that pri<lb/>soner had been in their employ for nine weeks about January, 1912, during which time they had found him industrious and capable.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. On July 23, 1900, I was convicted at this court for larceny from a warehouse, and I was sentenced to three years' penal servitude and two years' police supervision. I had been convicted previously seven times to that. I did not give an incorrect address when charged. I have been lately working at the theatres. I did not say to the warehouseman that I had come from Edmunds Brothers; I said I had worked there.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath) I was born in this country. I was in my father's business till he died. Since then I have worked for different people. While I was with Nesbit and Jardine I used to deliver these orders about four or live times a week at different depots, including Whitecross Street. The witnesses identified me at the police station because they knew me. They cannot swear it was me who had the stuff. I never went there on October 28. I had a wit<lb/>ness, but he was in the merchant service and has gone to sea. He could have told you where I was on that day. What I want to say further is written on that paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The name of my friend who went to sea is Sidney Erler. On October 28 I was looking for work all round the City. I have had in my hands orders initialled "M. B." A fellow named Adams used to go with delivery orders from Nesbit and Jardine as well as me. I spoke to Mr. Green at Whitecross Street depot about a situation. He told me to see the foreman. I told him I had seen the foreman. I did not tell him I was showing the new lad the different places he would have to call at. The witnesses are not telling the truth. I saw Gray outside the Great Northern premises on Octo<lb/>ber 28. I was on my way to Wood Street. After that I went to</p>

                  </hi>, manager to W. Medlock, potato merchant, King's Cross. On November 9 I saw 100 bags of our potatoes loaded on a Great Northern Railway truck. On November 11 I went to the same truck and misted 19 bags. We claimed £5 18s. 6d. for then. Flats and cuts are diseased and damaged potatoes. The contents of the 19 sacks were all sound. I do not know Saunders and have never bad any dealings with him.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY CHESTER</hi>, chief inspector of police, Great Northern Railway. On November 20 Inspector Staines brought Odd and Auf<lb/>forth into the office and told me that Odd was brought for stealing 19 bags of potatoes. I said, "You need not say anything unless you like; if you do say anything I may use it against you." Odd said to Aufforth, "At about five to four on the 9th you said to me, 'You can have one of these passes and get something out and I want a drink out of it.'" Aufforth replied, "No; I gave you no pass." Odd said, "You did." Aufforth turned to me and said, "Odd had a pass which I gave him: he said, 'I will see you later.' Before that Odd said to me, Make haste and get out of the road; we have got something on.' He said, 'Give me one of those passes,' which I did, thinking he would not have the heart to use it. It had 'A.G.A.,' my initials in indelible pencil on it. It was Medlock't pass for one bag of potatoes, which I collected at the same time. I was at the coal gate when Odd drove up. He was alone and had some sacks on his van. The pass he gave up was the one I had given him. I knew that when he gave it up. My initials had been rubbed off and the parcel altered to 20, then 40, and Police-constable Pitt, who collected it, said, 'I have got a catch.' I said, 'I reckon it is all right.'" Two metropolitan officers came in shortly afterwards and I told prisoners they would be charged, but they said nothing. They were taken to the station by the metro<lb/>politan officers. Aufforth would not be entitled to give Odd a pass.</p>

               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">FRED KIMBER</hi>, Y. On November 17 I went to 6, Robert Street with Staines. I took Odd to the elation, where he made a statement which was reduced into writing. Exhibit 1 is the state<lb/>ment. On November 20 I went to 12a, Hope Street, Eaton Road, Holloway. I saw Saunders and said to him, "I have two men in custody for stealing 19 sacks of potatoes from the Great Northern goods yard on November 9; you are suspected of receiving them" He said, "Nothing of the kind; I know nothing about the potatoes." I said, "One of the men in custody, Odd, has made a statement im<lb/>plicating you; I shall arrest you for receiving the potatoes; the state<lb/>ment will be read over to you on your arrival at the station." I then searched the premises and found the five sacks which have been produced. I said to Saunders, "These sacks are stamped with Med lock's name and I shall take possession of them." He then said, "I buy off a lot of people; if anyone comes round with a job lot at about 1/2 d. a lb. I have them." I then took him to Somers Town Police-Station and in the presence of Odd and Aufforth read this statement to him. Odd said nothing. Saunders said, "I reserve my defence"; then, turning to Odd, he said, "Did not you say they were flats and cuts and that you wanted to get rid of them?" When the charge was read over to them Saunders said, "Hold on, not £5 for flats and cuts."</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMBS SAMUELS</hi>, Y. On November 20 I took Aufforth to Somers Town Police Station. He said, "This is very hard on me; I have three children at home, one of them ill; I do not know what made me give him the pass."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On Saturday, November 9 I was on duty in the potato market, King's Cross. Odd, accompanied by another man, was standing round the corner of my box. Odd said to me, "Get up the road, I have something on," something which I took naturally to be anything, such as a row or a little argument. I think I had closed the gate then. He came up and said, "Give me a pass" or "Will you give me a pass?" I said "Yes," and gave his a pass, thinking he being the son of a carman, he would not have the heart to do the thing he did do, erase my name which is on the pass If he had not done that he could not get out with more than one sack of potatoes. He got nineteen. I did not know he had-stolen them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. "Get up the road" means foe wants you out of the road. I did not give a thought to what he meant by it. I did not ask any question. Having given the pass, I went to the coal gate and wrote a few little discrepancies out. I take up duty there from four to six. I stopped in front of the constable on duty there for about ten minutes for no reason whatever. I did not see that the pass had been altered until some three or four minutes after Odd gave it up.

               <p>had done wrong by giving a pass in the first place to a man I thought was honest, and he was not honest. I did not say a word to my superior officer after I found out that the pass had been forged. I saw Odd in the market two days afterwards. I did not say to him, "I had a hard job to stop the other constable fetching Mr. Staines. When are you going to give me my drink?" I said nothing to him.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I deal in all kinds of vege<lb/>tables in a email way. Odd came to me about 7.15 p.m. on November 9. It was raining. He had the sacks on his barrow; the mouths were all open. I had never seen him before. He asked me if I could do with some potatoes; I said I could at a price. I went out and looked at them; they were damaged by the weather. He asked 45s. I said I could buy them in the market for about £2. I thought he had been canvassing all the afternoon and that he had nineteen bags left out of twenty or twenty-one. I agreed to pay 30s., 10s. on account and the 20s. I paid him the following Tuesday. He did not say anything about his firm. He said the potatoes had come straight. He wanted something on account to show the firm he had sold them. I did not know that they were stolen. I paid a fair price in the condition they were. The police officer told me what he was going to charge me with. I said, "I reserve my defence." I may have said "I do not know anything about the other fourteen."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I may have said what the officer says I said. The bags as you see them now were not tied up. I did not know what to say because I was all of a heap, as you might say, when the officers came in and said I had been buying stolen potatoes. I am so used to buying off different people in the trade it was a shock to me. I was not represented at the police-court. I understood the magistrate to say that I had given a fair price. I did not see any name on the sacks.</p>

                  </hi>, managing clerk to Walpole and Co., solicitors, 90, Sackville Street, W. In the latter part of 1911 we were acting as solicitors for prisoner with reference to an interest he had under his father's will with a view to obtaining an advance. On December 20 he came, and in the presence of Mr. Walpole and myself said that Miss Sarah Atkinson was staying with him at his house in Clayton Street, Kennington, and that she had certain documents in some Chancery proceedings connected with his father's estate which we had asked for, and that she wanted £2 10s. expenses to which she had been put paid to her. Mr. Walpole agreed to pay this, and wrote a letter to her which he read to prisoner (Exhibit 2), enclosing a cheque for £2 10s. and stating that they understood from prisoner that she was forward<lb/>ing by that night's post certain copy documents relating to the will of the late Colonel Campbell, and that the cheque was sent on the clear understanding that unless such documents were received by the morrow morning payment of the cheque would be stopped. Exhibit 1 is the cheque, dated December 20, and is made payable to herself or her order. It purports now to be endorsed "Sarah Atkinson." The cheque and letter were handed to prisoner to give to her. No docu<lb/>ments arrived, and the cheque was stopped next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I am certain that you said that Sarah Atkinon was staying with you at 44, Clayton Street. You first came to the office about the end of November. It was on the morning of December 20 that you called and were given the cheque.</p>

I wished to see her in the first instance on the question of identify, and also to find out what had taken place since your father's death. You never said that Miss Atkinson lived with you at Clayton Street; you said that she had stayed with you two or three nights, coming up from Frimley. You implied that she was hostile to you. I did not see her until I saw her at Aoton Green. On the morning of December 21 I was at the office at 9.55, and I stopped the cheque at 10.30; I stayed at the office till 10.45.

Atkinson on January 11, as far as I remember, the cheque was not mentioned. I must have spoken to her about the cheque; but in any event she said she had not heard of me before, so she could not have Had the cheque. On that day I told you I would not have anything more to do with the business until I saw Mr. Topiham, who was supposed to be your attorney in the past; I do not remember writing you a letter after that. I knew long before January 11 that Taylor had cashed the cheque for you. Detective Duggan called on me last November.

He bought 4s. or 5s. worth of goods, and presented this cheque (Exhibit 1) which then bore the endorsement "S. Atkinson," which was scratched out and "Sarah Atkinson" inserted.

                  </hi> Gladstone Road, Acton Green. Prior to my marriage in 1881 my name was Sarah Atkinson; I am now a widow. I haven known prisoner since he was two years old. He is the son of Colonel Campbell, who died is 1876. I took a life interest under his will, and prisoner had an interest at my death. In 1893 on his return from Australia he came to see me at Bagshot, and said if I would give him £800 he would make no further claim upon me. He, my husband, and I went to London to see Mr. Topham, a solicitor. I then went to the bank and drew £800, I think it warn, which was handed through Mr. Topham to prisoner; as fur as I know he is not at present entitled to any interest until His father's will. I never saw this cheque (Ex<lb/>hibit 1)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010042"/>
               <p>until the police brought it to me. The endorsement on the back are not in my writing; I think they are in prisoner's. I gave him no authority to endorse the cheque. I have never been to 44, Clayton Street. I have no documents relating to Colonel Campbell, and I did not tell prisoner I would give them up if I was given £2 10s. I did not see him at all about the cheque. I had not seen him for about 18 months before January 11. I have never been to Mr. Wal<lb/>pole's office.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I was your father's housekeeper; I believe I was known as "Mrs. Campbell." I was sole executrix of his will. I had some papers relating to the will, but you took them from me when you took my home at Aldershot You never asked me to give you any in<lb/>formation. On your father's death I put the matter into the hands of a solicitor, Mr. Chalk. He told me not to put the money in Consols because I could get more interest at the bank, and the money remained on deposit at the bank. I believe the will was sworn at £3,000. Mr. Chalk used to give me the interest on it; he drew it for me. I never had any of the capital until alter the £800 was deducted; my husband them had the handling of it, my solicitor having given him the power. When a Miss Campbell died another £800 came in, but I never had it; Mr. Chalk borrowed it and paid me 5 per cent. I believe your father directed that the money should be invested in Consols. In January, 1911, you brought a gentleman who was a stranger to me to my house. When Mr. Walpole oame to see me I would not talk to him in your presence. When you had gone I told him I had not re<lb/>ceived any of the letters addressed to Clayton Street, as I was never there in my life. H never said anything about a cheque for £2 10s. Re-examined. I can write, and I could have endorsed the cheque myself. The reason I left Alderahot in 1893 was because business was so bad. Prisoner took away all the papers, including the dead he sigined when I gave him the £800; they were in a desk. The £800 that came from Miss Campbell was put into, I think, the Oriental Bank, but it went into liquidation and I had to take £400.</p>

                  </hi>, clerk, Principal Probate Registry, produced and proved the will of James Campbell, dated August 9, 1875. It was proved on February 8, 1877, by Sarah Atkinson, otherwise called Campbell, the sole executrix, to whom administration was granted. (The general residue was bequeathed to Sarah Atkinson for her life, and in the same manner to James Neil Campbell, the prisoner, for his life, and upon his decease the amount, £3,000, was to be paid to "the prin<lb/>cipal Asylum for the Blind in England.")</p>
               <p>Divisional Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS DUGGAN</hi>, L Division. On November 19 I charged prisoner with forging and uttering the endorse<lb/>ment upon this cheque for £2,100; obtaining certain goods and moneys from Taylor and Sons; and fraudulently converting the said cheque to his own use and benefit. He said, "It does not say what the fraudu<lb/>lent conversion is. I will say not guilty at present." When formally charged he said, "I am not guilty of the charge you make against me. I gave Sarah Atkinson 5s. on the night of the 20th and 45s. on the</p>

               <p>21st. The remaining evidence I will give to the magistrate when he questions me. You are aware that this is the second time Mrs. Mace has made a case against me." On October 12 I searched his house and I found this bundle of documents, amongst which was a document beaded, "Copy of letter received August 12, from Mr. Topham," and a letter from Mrs. Mace to him, dated July 28, 1911.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I have not been inside your house since October 12. The first time I saw you was the day I arrested you. On November 12 notice was given to the Public Prosecutor of your case. I offered you bail on October 12. I have made no inquiries for Mr. Mace, or made any investigation as to what has become of the money under your fiber's will.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the magistrate: "I say I am not guilty of the charge made against me of forgery and fraudulent conversion. I went over to Sarah Atkinson or Mace, and told her if she would give certain information respecting my father's will and my identity to Messrs. Walpole, I would pay her for it. We arranged 50s. for various documents and information. I told her I would give her the the money she asked me, but I should have to go to Piccadilly and get it from Walpole's. I went straight to Walpole's about 5 p.m., and in<lb/>formed Mr. Walpole of our interview. Mr. Walpole consented to give me a cheque for 50s., and did so, enclosed with the letter. I accord<lb/>ingly went across by appointment and handed her the letter in a pub. at Acton Green. On reading the cheque or seeing it she said, 'What good is this to me? You pranked to give me the money. She knew no one to cash it—did I If matters were so serious for me I could go to Walpole and get the cash and bring it to her. I informed her it was impossible for me to do that that night; it was about 7.15, but from faithful promises made by her the would write Walpole that night and inform him that she would call and give him all the information relating to my mother's will, I gave her 5s. all I could afford out of my own pocket, and: the balance in a pub. near Piccadilly tube. We had a chat there. I tried to get her to go up to Walpole's before I paid the balance, 45s. This she refused to do. I gave her 45s. on the 21st, and took a receipe on an envelope from her. She went up to Wal<lb/>pole's office in Sackville Street, and insisted on going up herself. I waited outside. I went up myself after she came down, and found what she told me; no one was at the office. I went up again by my<lb/>self I then 'phoned the office, and the caretaker instructed me to 'phone Eirl's Court to Mr. Walpole. I did so, and was informed Mr. Walpole was in the country. When Mr. Walpole returned I took Mr. Walpole to her (Sarah Atkinson). He had an interview of about three-quarters of an hour with her. He came down and informed me at Walpole's that I should hear from him later, but he has never written to me nor Sarah Atkinson intimating any dispute or forgery of this cheque. Nor has he written to Taylor's. The paper from the Crown Prosecutor is my first knowledge of the charge of forgery. This is the second time that Sarah Atkinson has made a similar charge againt me, and has swindled me and the Blind Asylum out of my</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath) repeated in effect the state ments he had made before the magistrate, and added: I was under Sarah Atkinson's care till I was 14, when my father died. He left her his money for life and at her death it was to revert to me. I now find she was not a penny left of and she has never given me any money for my interest. On my return to England in 1887 I saw a Mr. Top<lb/>ham, my attorney, and he advised me to go and see her. The receipt that Sarah Atkinson gave me for the 45s. was amongst the papers that Detective Duggan took away from my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Before I went to Mr. Walpole on December 20 I had seen Sarah Atkinson several times at her house to arrange with her to give me these papers; only on one occasion was anybody else present One of the documents was a warrant, I think Mr. Walpole called it, showing the money had been invested in Consols, and another was my certificate of 'birth. I wanted to get a loan from Mr. Walpole and he wanted to see certain documents which Sarah Atkinson said she had. She also agreed to supply information as to an insurance policy on her life, which Mr. Topham held on my behalf. The signature on the docu<lb/>ment (Exhibit 8) appears to be mine; I still say that she defrauded the Blind Asylum, although I say in the letter that the gift over to the Principal Blind Asylum "had been so vague that Chancery proceed<lb/>ings relating to it resulted in my favour. I cannot remember the name of the publichouse at Acton Green in which met Sarah Atkinson as I am a stranger in that neighbourhood. I had made appointments with her there before and I knew where it was. The endorsement on the cheque is not in my writing and I can see no comparison between that and my signature on Exhibit 9. I did not see her endorse it; I know nothing about it further than she returned it to me endorsed; it had been endorsed in the interval between her going out to try and cash the cheque and her return. I cannot remember the name of the public-house near the Piccadilly Tube, where I met her by arrangement next day. I admit these sheets containing Mr. Topham's signature were found at my house; I wrote them as a pastime. This copy of a letter (Exhibit 6) to me from Mr. Topham is in my writing; it is not a draft of a supposed letter from him which I wrote; it is an actual copy of the original. It purports to some from the Tasmanian Club, Hobart. The reason I had these sheets printed with the beading was because I wished to make facsimile copies of letters that he wrote to me for business purposes; you cannot get a small number of sheets from a printer; I used them in negotiating for a loan in connection with my mother's money.</p>

Pri<lb/>soner said he wanted notes, four £5 notes and gold. Having doubts as to the genuiness of the cheque I spoke to the manager who came to the desk.

I examined it and very quickly came to the con<lb/>clusion that there was something wrong with it. I went to the counter and asked prisoner how he came by it. He told me it was given him by a gentleman down the Strand and I got him to come to my room, where I questioned him further as to who the gentleman was. He said his name was Goodgames and he had known him about six yean; he could not tell me his Christian name or address, but he had knows him by playing billiards with him and he was connected with the Turf. He said Goodgames was waiting in the tavern nearest to us in the Strand. We visited that house but did not find Goodgames there. I sent for the police and prisoner was given in charge. I accompanied prisoner and the constable to the tavern to give prisoner an oppor<lb/>tunity to find Goodgames. He could not find him. We all then went to Bow Street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner said he did not come from Mr. Dymont He made no attempt to escape. He could easily have got away.</p>

Prisoner then said, "There is evidently something wrong. A man gave it to me to cash: his name is Goodgames, and he is waiting by the public-house down the street for me." I went with the manager and prisoner to the public-house. Prisoner looked in the bar and said, "He is not there."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath). I live at 176, Hampstead Road. I have known Goodgames about six years, not very intimately. I got to know him through a Mr. Johnson, who had an employment agency in the Strand. On November 19 I met Goodgames at the "Horseshoe," Tottenham Court Road. He told me he wanted to cash a cheque. As we got within two or three doors of the bank he said to me, "Do you mind running and cashing this cheque for met" and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010047"/>
               <p>pointed out the bank. He said, "Get £20 in notes and the rest in gold, or £20 gold and the rest in note." The reason he asked me to go was that he saw a man in front of him whom he wished to speak to. He said, "I shall be here when you come out." That was outside the tavern. I had no cause to be suspicious. I did not look at the cheque. I tendered it to the cashier. He asked if I came from Mr. Williams; I told him no. He looked at the cheque again and said he would get the manager's consent, murmuring something about "pay cash," and that they had some rules and regulations from the Bankers' Association that they should not pay unless I was known at the bank. He came back in about a minute and a half; then the manager oame. What he said is quite correct. Three of us went to fee "George" There was quite a crowd. I could not see Goodgames. We simply looked at the front door of the tavern. I did not go inside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I met Goodgames at 11 a.m. I do not know he address. At one tome six months ago be stopped at the "Horseshoe," to I was led to understand. I met him accidentally the day previous; he asked me if I was doing anything; I said no; he told me he (thought he could get me about three months' work in the country in the sausage<lb/>skin line. He treated me to a drink in the "Horseshoe;" and said he would like to meet me next morning at 11; I suppose it was concerning this two or three months' work; I did not ask him. I turned up as about the country employment; we talked about racing. I think he made a book at one time. When we came out of the bank there was a crowd of about 150 people. I told them at Bow Street where they might find Goodgames.</p>

On November 8, between 11 and 12 p.m., I left the Home with other sailors to go to my boat at the Commercial Dock. I stopped at a coffee stall and paid for two cups of coffee for two women. I had a parcel which I put on the counter. A man took the parcel up and ran away. I followed and caught him, when others interfered with me. Prisoner was one of the men at the coffee-stall. They tried to prevent me going down the Commercial Road. I wanted to get away, but they formed a ring; I made a rush to get past when one tripped me up. They knocked me about with their fists, one hit me with an instrument, others kicked me while I was on the ground. 17s. was taken from my pocket. They then ran away, leaving me on the ground. I was then taken to the police station, where my injuries were dressed by the doctor. On November 10 I was shown a row of men, from whom I picked the prisoner out as one who had taken part in the robbery. I had given a complete description of him to the police.</p>

As the prisoner had lost his right arm the other men were directed to take their right arms from their coat sleeves and place the sleeve in the pocket in a similar position to the prisoner. Without any hesitation prosecutor walked up the line and identified the prisoner. He after<lb/>wards picked out another man. Prisoner was then charged; he said, "Well, I shall plead not guilty."</p>

He bought a cup of tea for one young lady and then went away and spoke to them. They went away and left him. He came back and called for teas, and when asked to pay 1s. he had no money to pay. There was a free fight between him and the men who were with him—everybody for himself—but I saw nobody trying to rob him. I went away and left them fighting."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am 21 years of age. On November 8, between 11 and 12 p.m., I was in the Commercial Road and reached the coffee stall at 12.30 and had a cup of tea. Prosecutor then came up with about fourteen others and two young women. He called for coffees. He and the others commenced arguing about pay<lb/>ing; prosecutor said he would not pay, and a general fight started. I walked away and left them fighting. I was standing close to the stall; I never hit the prosecutor or went through his pockets. I did not see him knocked down or robbed. When I left he was arguing the point about paying 1s. for the coffee with the woman who kept the coffee stall. I went home. I never saw him attacked at all. What took place after I left I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I got to the coffee stall about ten minutes before prosecutor. The men with the prisoner, were foreigners—his ship<lb/>nates. I know nothing about prosecutor coming there between 11 and 12. The fight was commenced between the prosecutor and his com<lb/>panions when I went away; they were fighting amongst themselves.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">BERTIE SIMMS</hi> recalled. (To the Jury) Prosecutor was brought to the station at about 1.20 a.m. The station is about fifteen to twenty minutes' walk from the coffee stall. Prosecutor walked with assistance. He was sober. I have made enquiries but I have not been able to get a sufficient description of the other men on which I can take action.</p>

                  </hi>, 201, Stanstead Road, Forest Hill, widow. My daughter, Millie Clark, is married, but was giving up her house and taking a situation owing to her husband's desertion. She asked me to dispose of her furniture; at my request prisoner, who keeps an up<lb/>holsterer's shop, came to see me on May 1, and said he thought he had a customer who would buy the goods. He said, "Shall I take my customer to the rooms to see the furniture or shall I have the furniture at my shop and dust it up so that it will show to more advantage and the man will see it better?" I allowed him to take the furniture away to show his customer. After that I frequently saw the furniture in his stop. A week or two after he had it he said he would re-upholster it, as his customer would not buy it otherwise. He said he would give me £8 6s. for the furniture. I agreed that all I wanted for my daughter's furniture was £8 6s., and I did not mind how much he got for it or what he did with it. I called on him about 20 times. At about the beginning of August I found the furniture was not in prisoner's shop; prisoner said he would give me the money for it. One day in Septem<lb/>ber I found the shop was empty and the prisoner gone. As I could not find him I went to the police on October 19, and on November 2 I charged him at the police station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. You said you could not buy the funrni<lb/>ture, but would find a customer for me. You paid the carriage of the furniture from my daughter's house in Brockley to your shop. I saw the suite stripped in your shop being upholstered; you said you had a customer, and I did not mind.</p>
               <p>The Recorder held that the claim was a matter for a Civil Court.</p>

               <p>back in eight or nine minutes' time and got into my cab, and directed me to drive to Aberdeen Place, Maida Vale. I drove to Aberdeen Place and pulled up opposite Lyons's Mews. They got out. J. H. Gale said, "We are going down West in about 10 minutes, will you wait?" I said, "Yes." They went down Edgware Road. After I had waited 12 to 14 minutes all three prisoners came running up. J. H. Gale, who was bare-headed, was pointing a revolver at a crowd which was following. I was standing at the side of my taxi-cab. He then pointed his revolver at me and said, "Get up on it." I said, "No." He said, "I will hold you up if you do not," so I thought it was wise to drive away to save life and wait for a more favourable opportunity to give them into custody. I could not say whether the other two prisoners had revolvers or not; I was confuted. The revolver which J.H. Gale had in his hand was something like that produced. J.H. Gele got on the footboard by my side and the other two got inside. J.H. Gale said, "Get away, drive on," I did so. He said, "Go to Liverpool Street Station." On the way I stopped at the corner of Wardour Street and Oxford Street, where two men got out of the oar, walked down Wardour Street, and returned. They said, "Drive to a pawn<lb/>broker's." I drove to Attenborough's, in Oxford street. J.H. Gele and one of the others went in, stayed a quarter of an hour, and re<lb/>turned to the cab. I then drove to Moorgate Street, where J.H. Gale and one of the others went into a hat shop. When I started from Edg<lb/>ware Road they pulled the windows down and gave J.H. Gale a cap. On coming out of the hat shop both prisoners had hat-shape parcels. I drove on and was held up by the traffic in Finsbury Circus. All I three prisoners then alighted; J.H. Gate paid me the fare, 10s., asking the total he had paid me 14s. They all went away. I went to the nearest cab rank to consider the matter; after I had pulled my<lb/>self round I gave information at Scotland Yard at between 11.30 and 12 noon. I did not call a policeman while they were in the cub; I was afraid they would shoot me. About three weeks afterwards, at Marylebone Police Court, I picked J.H. Gale out from a row of eight or nine other men. I could not pick out the other two prisoners, though they were in the line. A week before I had seen all three prisoners in the dock charged with this offence; I said to a police constable that J.H. Gale was very much like the man. I was not sure of him then, but the week afterwards when I saw them put up for identification in a row of other men it seemed to come to me more, and I was sure of J.H. Gale.</p>
               <p>The Recorder s'ated that the identification appeared to be a most, irregular proceeding.</p>

On October 14, at about 9.30 a.m., a man, whom I cannot identify, came into the shop and asked to see same silver watches. He went out without making any purchase, Being suspicious I followed him to the door; he walked down the Edgware Road to the corner of Market Street and joined some other men. I think they then walked down Market Street together.</p>

Gale and Leslie Gale came in. Leslie asked to see a diamond ring in the window; I showed him the ring (produced) at £4 10s.; he handed it to J.H. Gale, who said, "We had better see something better." I took a diamond ring from the window (Exhibit 5), price £45—it cost £36—and handed it to J.H. Gale. He said "This is too much, we want one about, £30." Getting suspicious, I said, "Give me that ring back." J.H. Gale then produced a revolt; similar to the one produced, and said, "Stand back." I hesitated for a moment and then sprang at him. We struggled; he broke away from my hold and ran out with the two rings. The others had left. I ran alter them to Aberdeen Place where they got into a taxi, which drove off. J.H. Gale was on the footboard, holding a revolver; one of them was leaning out of the window. I found the cap produced a the shop, which I believe was worn by Leslie. On November 5 I west to John Street Police Station and picked out the three prisoners from a row of men. J.H. Gale came forward and said, "We should not have hurt you Frank, shake hands."</p>

Gale, Who was wearing a green scarf similar to the one he has on now, handed me a diamond ring, and asked £30. I asked him if it was his own, and he said, it was. I offered him £20, and he accepted it I gave him that sum and a contract note, which I saw him sign in the name of "Herbert Blake, 20, Newman Street W. Whilst waiting for the contract note he bought some cigars; he was the other prisoners were in the shop about 10 minutes. On Novem<lb/>ber 13 I identified them at the Marylebone Police Court.</p>

               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN McPHERSON</hi>, D Division. On the evening of Novem<lb/>ber 5 I was keeping observation on the "Royal Oak," when I with other officers followed Mm. Gale to Chepstone Place, Bayswater, where she joined her husband. Shortly afterwards the two prisoners Gale appeared from a side street and were proceeding in the direction of their parents' when I and another officer took them into custody. I said, "We are police officers. We are going to arrest you for stealing on October 14 from Bother's two diamond rings and threatening to shoot, concerned with another man whose name I cannot give you." J. H. Gale replied, "All right; we won't struggle. Let me speak to my mother." I said, "Have you got a revolver?" He replied, "I have a dummy." I then took this water pistol (Exhibit 1) from his pocket. He said, pointing to ins brother Leslie, "His is not a dummy." Police-constable Mallett took this five-chambered revolver (Exhibit 2) from him. On the way to the station in a cab J.H. Gale said, "I could have shot the manager of Bosher's if. I liked, but instead I placed the revolver back in my pocket and tried to get away. He got me round the neck and I got away. I did not want to do anyone any harm. I plead guilty, and I am very sorry." At the station I said to them, "You will be put up for identification." J.H. Gale laid, "We don't want to be put up." I said, "Very well," and they were both charged. They were wearing these bowler hats (Exhibits 7 and 8). I produce the cloth cap found at Bosher's shop.</p>
               <p>To J.H. Gale. You did not deny stealing the jewellery when I arrested you. I did not warn you that whatever you said would be used against you.</p>
               <p>To Leslie Gale. I did not tell you you could destroy the hats if you wished.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE HADLOW, D</hi> Division. I was with Inspector McPherson, when he arrested prisoner on November 5. On the way to the station in the cab I noticed Leslie fidgetting about with his coat. He dived hia hand into his waistcoat pocket. I caught bold of his land, and found five live, two spent, and one damaged cartridge (Ex<lb/>hibit 9). He said, "That is all have got; I have not wed any on anyone."</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR MALLETT</hi>, D Division. I arrested Leslie on November 5. I said to him, "I am a police officer." He said, "All right, I won't struggle. I could have shot you had I wanted to." I asked him where his revolver was, and he said, "In my pocket." I found this fully-loaded five-chamber revolver (Exihibit 2.) At the station to said, "As for the shooting at Edgware Road, I only wanted to keep the people back—only to frighten them. I had no intention of shooting." J.H. Gale said, "l am surprised that Mr. Haycock did not recognise us. He has seen us lots of times."</p>
               <p>Prisoners, called upon for their defence, stated that they did not de sire to give evidence upon oath, but handed in a statement, signed by J.H. Gale, which they said embodied all they had to say. The state<lb/>ment was: "I left home, 26, Delamere Crescent, Paddington, W., just after 10 o'clock Monday morning, October 14. There are five witness</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010054"/>
               <p>to prove that I took the motor-bus to Gloucester Place, Marylebone Road. I walked past my young lady's place, where she was engaged as a maid. She waved her hand to me. This was about 25 past 10. I then took train from Baker Street to Liverpool Street, and met my brother. We went into a public-house opposite. This was just before 11o'clock. When we had been there about 10 minutes I was surprised to see George Hayes with two other fellows in there. We fell into conversation, and one fellow, known as Jim Robinson, asked us if we could pawn a ring for him. They seemed to be drinking. We changed our caps for their bowler hate. I took the ring in. I signed the contract for £20 in the name of Blake, 20, Newman Street I had never seen the fellows before, only Hayes. I know him well. I had no idea the ring was stolen. Robinson seemed pleased, and gave me £2. We then parted. Hayes will confess in the witness-box, and I hope will clear my brother and myself. I am sorry we made con<lb/>feasion, but never knew it was to be used against us. We only did it on impulse and excitement; we had been drinking. It is all true; making confession upon November 5 was only done for a lark. Leslie asked me to have a sport with the detectives. My mother knew I was innocent, and I can prove an alibi with six witnesses. I would have contradicted my statement of guilty next morning only Mr. Hill (solicitor) advised me not just yet. Frank Haycock came and identi<lb/>fied us without hesitation, because he had seen my brother and self at police station when arrested. When the taxi-driver came in I asked Hayes who he was. I never knew the man; even Hayes told us it was the taxi-driver. I could not help smiling when he came and identified me, but he stated in court he had seen me the previous week in court before I was put up for identification. I had on a green scarf and a green overcoat, which had been printed in all the newspapers and that is what the witness went for."</p>

                  </hi>. On November 21 I was employed by Wisbey's as assistant salesman. I think I first met prisoner about seven weeks ago in London Wall. We passed the time of day and spoke business. He said if I could get hold of anything and took it round to his house be would buy it of me. I have seen him at Wisbey's. I do not know if he has seen me. He knew where I was employed. These brushes came from Wisbey's. I took them to Mr. Shine's tike night before I was taken into custody. He met me in. Barnsbury. I sold him the pipes at dinner-time. To the beat of my belief we had three deals; they came to 23s.; I received only 10s. They were not job lots Pri<lb/>soner never asked if they were job lots.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Wisbey's is a very busy place. I have seen pri<lb/>soner in and out nearly all the three yean I was there. I had never spoken or nodded to him. I could not tell you if I had a conversation with him about his chest when I met him in London Wall. I would not swear he did not say he was suffering from consumption. He said he wanted to go to a hospital to get treatment. I said, "I am a life governor of a hospital myself and can get you a ticket." I gave him my address and told him to come to my house for a ticket. I believe I took the ticket when I took the thongs over. I do not think he asked me what I did for a living. I did not say, "I deal in job goods of any description." I may have mentioned pianos. I was a dealer in pianos I had a bag containing some goods. I could not tell you if I said to him, "I have got a few odds and ends here; could you do with them?" I night have done. I produced some side-combs, dressing-combs, a few purses and mouth-organs. I said, "These are odds and ends; give me 12s. for them." He wad, "I will give 10S."</p>
               <p>Detective-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">FRENCH</hi>, City Police. On November 21 I arrested Charles White on a charge of stealing property belonging to his employer. He made a communication to me, in consequence of which I accompanied him to Bell Lane, where he pointed out prisoner. I I said to prisoner, "I am a police officer, and I am going to arrest you with this man White for stealing and receiving some pipes, a cigarette I tube, and other articles, the property of Messrs. Wisbey." Prisoner said, "You have made a mistakes" He then said, "I did buy some pipes in the dinner hour, and if you like to come round home I will show them to you." I went to his home, where the pipes were</p>

               <p>produced and the cigarette-holder. I searched the house and found various other property. (Witness identified the pipes.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When the pipes were found he said, "I am a job buyer; I bought some pipes and combs from this man," pointing to<lb/>White, "who I thought was a job buyer also."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 5, Palmer Street. I have been a job buyer for 20 years. I have been doing business with Wisbey's over ten years. I have all the receipt. I am suffering from. consumption. I have been in four hospitals. About six weeks be<lb/>fore my arrest White approached me in London Wall. He said, "Hullo." I looked at him for a minute. I had seen him once or twice at Wisbey's; I thought he was a traveller. He said, "How are—you going on" I said, "I don't feel well, I am going to get a letter." He said, "l am life governor of a hospital; come to 26, Offord Road, and I will give you a letter." I did, and was glad to get the letter. At his house he asked me what I was doing. I said, "Buying job lots, what are you doing?" He said, "I have been working for a firm about 15 yean in pianos "; did not mention any name. I thought he was gentlemen; he had a very nice place. He produced a brown bag containing these pipes and other things. He asked 12s. I did not ask him where he got them from. I said, "I will allow you 10s. for them." I kept them for three weeks; I was trying to save the stuff for Christmas so as to buy the children some clothes. Three weeks follow<lb/>ing he came to my house. He asked for 12s. I said, "I will five you 10s. in the dinner hour." The day following he sold me the pipes and; cigarette holder. He asked 4s.; I gave him 3s. You can buy them as 10s., 12s., and 15s. a dozen in any shop in Houndsditch. I have been carrying on business as a job buyer 20 yean in London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was not frequently in Wisbey's during the two-months before November 21. I might go in. now and again, and the governor would say, "Shine, I have not got anything for you to-day." I never saw White in the basement. Job buyers do not ask where the goods come from. I thought that White was a traveller. I did not know he was employed at Wisbey's or I should not have bought them. How could I think he worked there when I met him in London Wall?

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE JAMESON</hi>, J Division. On Novem<lb/>ber 9, about 11.30 p.m., I was on duty in Cambridge Road. £.; I was with Sergeant Silver; we were in uniform. Just by the Foresters' Music Hall a number of young men and women got off a tramcar and went towards the hall singing and shouting. I heard a revolver shot; on turning I saw prisoner discharge a second shot; he was in the middle of the road and the shot was fired in the air. I ran and seized him; he then pointed the revolver at my head and fired; it did not wound me, but blew my helmet off. He then printed the revolver at the lower part of my body and fired twice more; one bullet passed through my great<lb/>coat and struck my trousers. Silver and I took prisoner to the station; he was very violent on the way. The crowd following as threw missiles, and I was struck on the head by a glass bottle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. It is not true that the revolver went off by accident, owing to Silver pressing your hand down. You fired the shots before Silver came up.</p>

               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES OLIVER</hi>. I have had many years' experience in revolvers. The revolver produced is an exceptionally heavy one, with a pull (working double action) of 25 lbs.; the normal pull of an ordi<lb/>nary revolver would be 6 or 7 lbs.</p>

                  </hi>, 6, Milgate Park, Bearsted, Maidstone, brewer. In the beginning of 1911 I met prisoner, and had discussion with regard to coal in Kent. Several letters ensued, and on March 13 I advanced him £250 by cheque to facilitate the preparing for search<lb/>ing for coal I had property in Kent, on which he hoped to find coil On March 28 I advanced £350 for the same purpose. Prisoner signed agreement (produced) of March 21, 1911. Several letters passed. Pri<lb/>soner told me he had an interest in the Novel Electric Theatres, Limited, and gave me as security for the advance certificate (produced) for £2,100 Debentures, and as stated in agreement of May 21, 1911, signed by prisoner and myself, he agreed to pay me the monthly in<lb/>terest of £12 5s. On May 29, 1911, I guaranteed prisoner's account with the London County and Westminster Bank, Maids-tone Branch, for overdrafts not exceeding £1,500. Prisoner handed me blank transfer of £2,100 Debentures of the Novel Electric Theatres, Limted, (A large number of Utters were identified by the witness.)</p>

                  </hi>, recalled, cross-examined by prisoner. I joined this syndicate partly to benefit the county of Kent, partly be<lb/>cause it was supposed to be a very good thing for my property and would benefit neighbouring properties. I joined it as a speculation I have not asked for this prosecution or made any allegation of fraud against you. I did not conceive you intended to defraud me. I did not swear the information; I simply handed the documents to my solicitor, Mr. Monckton, for his inspection; I did not read the certifi<lb/>cate. I left it to Mr. Monckton to find out what had become of the money I had advanced. You turned it to your own personal purposes a good deal. I am a witness here merely on subpoena, with no inten<lb/>tion of prosecuting.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I parted with my two cheques of £250 and £350 to support the venture—for the work of boring and other initial expenses I considered I had a mortgage on the Electric Theatre Debenture, but I left the matter entirely to Mr. Monckton. The agreement states that the prisoner is the registered holder of £2,100 sterling First Mortgage Seven per Cent. Debentures, secured upon the Novelty Theatre, Brighton, and that he charges all his property and interest in the said £2,100 Debentures to me as security for moneys already ad<lb/>vanced or to be provided or guaranteed by me; the interest accruing on Me said £2,100 is also charged for my benefit until I am paid 10 per cent, interest on all moneys advanced.</p>

                  </hi>, of Monckton, Son, and Collett, soli<lb/>citors, Maidstone. I act as solicitor for Mr. Fremlin. I first heard of prisoner on May 25, 1911, when Fremlin handed me agreement, dated March 24,1911, between him and prisoner. I was not definitely instructed any further until early in July, When Fremlin handed me transfer of £2,100 Debentures. On July 17 prisoner wrote me letter (produced), stating that Fremlin had found £600 cash and £1,500 by a bank guarantee. "This has been spent by me as to £800 on my private account, as to £300 on the registration, costs, etc., £400 on Stock Ex<lb/>change quotations etc., £600 on publicity, circularising, printing, etc., and on this last account I should have about £300 to find for which I am liable, making £2,400 about in. all or more" I consulted Fremlin, wrote to prisoner, and issued a writ for £1,550 11s. 1d., the amount of the guaranteed overdraft and interest. Under Order 14 I obtained judgement for immediate payment of £800, prisoner having leave to de<lb/>fend for the balance. Prisoner appealed, and the Court of Appeal dis<lb/>missed the appeal with costs. On May 22, 1912, bankruptcy proceed<lb/>ings were commenced by petition against prisoner. After negotia<lb/>tion prisoner paid £650 in settlement of the judgment and costs, the claim for the balance of the £1,550 remaining in abeyance; that action has not been proceeded with. On January 16, 1912, a winding-up order was made of the Kent Outcrop Coal Syndicate on a petition of Fremlin and other shareholders.</p>

                  </hi>, Lysander Grove, Highgate, manager to the Cinema de Luxe, 65, Strand. In September, 1910, I was secretary of the Novel Eleotric Theatres, Limited, of which the nominal capital was £15,000 in shares of 5s. each. Prisoner was promoter and shareholder. The offices were at Rupert Street, Shaftesbury Avenue, afterwards at Moor<lb/>gate Street, and afterwards at Brighton, where the company owned the Novelty Picture Theatre. Twenty-five Debentures of £100 each were created, four of which were issued to Pye Smith and 21 to prisoner (produced). The 21 issued to prisoner are endorsed." This is to certify the present holders of this Debenture are Hurman Samuel, Stewart Samuel, and Sidney Arthur Samuel, 10, Southampton Row, Holborn. November 9,1910." Signed by me, "John J. Bye, Secre<lb/>tary." They were sent to me by Samuels' solicitors. Transfer (pro<lb/>duced) of October 10, 1910, is by prisoner to Samuels of the same 21 Debentures, and is signed by prisoner. A further document signed, by prisoner states that 21 Debentures are pledged to Messrs. Findings (Samuels) as security. I informed prisoner that I had endorsed the Debentures and received the transfer. Blank transfer (produced) signed by Jackson purports to refer to the same 21 Debentures, and has written upon it "Certificate for £2,100 Debentures in company's office, Novel Electric Theatres, Limited, John Bye, Secretary." I ceased to be secretary May 23, 1911. I had previously left with pri<lb/>soner at his office, 118, London Wall, bland certified transfers for shares to which he was then entitled. The blank transfer (produced) was signed by me under the" words "Certificate for shares," etc—the word shares has been erased and" £2,100 Debentures"</p>

The signature of that name to the acceptance on bill produced is in prisoner's writing. I had nothing to do with the Kent Outcrop Coal Syndicate, Limited.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. The conditions printed on the Debentures require a transfer thereof to be entered on the register. So far as I know you continued to be the registered holder on the books of the 21 Debentures in question. I attended very few meetings of the Novel Electric Theatres Company. I wrote up the minutes from drafts supplied by you. I received the transfer from Samuels' representative at the strand Theatre; he was sent to me by you. I told you I had received your transfer, together with the 21 Debentures. You said, Keep the transfer until the next meeting of directors. I signed the en<lb/>dorsement on the Debentures, returned them to Samuels' representa<lb/>tive, and put the transfer away amongst other papers. Nominally there were two directors, and I was secretary. I have been employed by Samuels since March, 1911.</p>

                  </hi>, of Windy bank, Samuel, and Lawrence 7, Oxford Court, Cannon Street. My firm are solicitors to Fieldings, a partnership consisting of three Messrs. Samuel. In September and October, 1910, prisoner had loans from Samuels amounting to £2,100 on the security of brokers' contracts for shares in the Novel Electric Theatre. A further £1,000 was then lent on a mortgage of the lease of 53, Strand, and 21 mortgaged Debentures of £100 each in the Novel Electric Theatres, Limited. Prisoner gave a promissory note for £1,300 of October 10, 1910, 21 Debentures, and signed transfer for same (produced). I sent my clerk to the registered office of the com<lb/>pany to have the transfer registered; the Debentures were endorsed by the secretary as the (property of Samuels. Only about £200 of the loans was repaid; Samuels took possession of the theatre at 53, Strand, and Mr. Bye was employed to manage it. We took proceedings for the appointment of a Receiver, when we heard the company was in liquidation. A Receiver for the Debenture holders was appointed Jane 21, 1911. We realised about £20 from the movable effects at the Brighton Theatre. The positron with regard to the Strand Theatre was very difficult because the landlord had issued a writ for possession and would not allow prisoner to assign to Samuels; but he said he would grant a fresh lease to Samuels if he got judgment in his action against prisoner for possession. Prisoner instructed us to consent to that on his behalf in order to facilitate Samuels dealing with their securities; then the landlord granted a new lease to Samuels. They deal with it as mortgagees and ceiled in accountants, who valued at about £3,000, and it was sold at that amount to them., the Wince of prisoner's debt being still owing.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. The order for a Receiver directs an inquiry as to who—are the Debenture holders. (There is nothing in the order including or excluding Samuels specifically; the action is in the name of Pye Smith and other Debenture holders. We had the secretary's endorse<lb/>ment on the Debenture Showing that Samuels were the holders and did not think it necessary to inspect the register to see if the transfer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010064"/>
               <p>was registered. It came as a surprise to us that the company were resisting the appointment of a Receiver on the ground that the Debes<lb/>tures were not registered. You put in no defence to the action and we thought it unnecessary to go on with the inquiry. I took possession of the Strand Theatre in March, 1911. I have not rendered an account to you because none has been asked for; you know what is owing.</p>

                  </hi>, 6, Grocers' Hall Court, accountant. In October, 1911, prisoner applied to me for a loan of £500 on 5,000 5s. shares of the Navel Electric Theatres Company and a bill of the Kent Outcrop Company; I declined. He then said he wanted some money to pay wages, handed me certificate for 5,000 shares with signed blank transfer, and four months' bill produced of the Kent Outcrop Company for £200, dated June 29, due November 1, 1911, payable at London County and Westminster Bank, Maidstone, signed by W. Pincott Hill (Chairman), David Martin (Director), Cyril A. Carew (Secretary), drawn and endorsed by Andrew Jackson; he also gave me cheque dated October 16, 1911, drawn by Andrew L. Jack<lb/>son on the British Linen Bank to me for £42. I then lent him £40. The cheque was held over for three weeks at the request of prisoner, presented, and returned dishonoured. I instructed my solicitors to take proceedings for the payment of the bill and then learned that the Kent Outcrop Company had gone into liquidation. I attempted to get the shares registered, but failed to find the registered office of the Novelty Company. At the time I parted with my £40 I thought the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010065"/>
               <p>due date of the bill was as noted upon it; prisoner told me that if I rang up the solicitors of the company they would confirm the fact that the bill was in order and that it would be paid. I did not do so as I thought his assurance good enough. If I had known that the bill had been altered from one month to four months and was then overdue I should not have parted with my money; I thought it was a current bill. With regard to the Kent Outcrop Company, prisoner produced to me the memorandum and articles and pointed out that Fremlin had subscribed for 4,000 shares.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I do not know whether the Liquidator has repudiated the bill or that it does not represent a just liability of the company. If the bill is a good bill the fact that it us physically altered would not master to me. I have been informed by the Companies Winding-up Department that the bill has been altered from two months to four months; consequently I was not the holder in due course and had no better title than you. When the bill became due the company was still in existence; it has not repudiated the bill. The securities operated on my mind in parting with my £40. Ton sent me a cheque for £1 1s. for holding over your cheque for £42, but it was dis<lb/>honoured. I did not bother about your cheque for £42 being dis<lb/>honoured as I thought you would be certain to want your shares and would come and pay up. I do not think the proof for the bill has been disallowed.</p>

                  </hi>, 11, Houghton Place, estate agent. I have known prisoner since the middle of 1909. I had office accommodation at his offices, 180, London Wall. About June, 1911, prisoner asked me to set as temporary director of the Kent Outcrop Company, as somebody had not turned up. I attended a meeting. Pincott Hill, Pakeman, and prisoner were there. Under Pakesman's directions I signed the necessary documents for registering the company. I afterwards at<lb/>tended three more meetings. I had no interest in the company; I never saw the secretary, who I understood was Richards. Prisoner was supposed to be the promoter. I do not know of any shares being issued to him. The minutes state "Preliminary expenses, including the registration of the company and all charges for printing, etc.; except the solicitor's costs, have been agreed at £600." Prisoner re<lb/>ported that that had been agreed with Mr. Pakeman; it was to be paid to prisoner for acting as promoter; I never heard of Cyril A. Carew until I saw a bill with his name on it at the Official Receiver's; I think there is no such person. I was present when two letters were authorised to the bankers, enclosing a cheque of £2 for opening an account, and requesting an overdraft of £500. Prisoner brought them forward; he laid two sovereigns on the table and took them up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010066"/>
               <p>again. I did not nee the signature "C. A. Carew"—I think it is pri<lb/>soner's writing. On June 28 I attended a meeting; Hill and Jackson were present. It was resolved to accept the following bills in respect of the £500 which prisoner said had been agreed to be paid him:—June 28, £150 at one month; June 28, £150 at two months; June 29, £200 at two months—all drawn by prisoner on the company. Hill and myself accepted the bills as directors. The signature of C. A Carew was put on afterwards—it is prisoner's writing. I assumed Richards's name would appear as secretary. The bill for £150 is altered to lour months in prisoner's handwriting; I never authorised the alteration. The same applies to the £200 bill. I resigned my directorship on Jane 28.</p>

                  </hi>, Grove Court, Drayton Gardens, S.W. About 2.45 p.m. October 15 I was walking down Victoria Road, towards High Street. I was carrying this bag in my hand; the chain was twisted round my finger. It contained this purse, which had in it a £5 note, two or three shillings, and a few coppers. Three men came running from the High Street end. I think I can identify Nelson England. His face was dirty. The first man made a dash at me and tried to take my bag but could not get it; then he gave me a push the chain broke and I fell; the hag flew past me, and the purse fell out close to my hand. I put out my hand to try and pick it up; and then this man stopped over me and picked up tie purse and bag and ran on. I said in the police court that I thought one man did it all; he is England. I have been dreadfully ill since; the doctor came twice a day for a long time. Both bones of my left leg were broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Edwards. I could not identify you.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by England. The second time I was at the police court I said of the three men you looked most like the man.</p>

                  </hi>, 6, South End Gardens, Kensington. I was walking in Victoria Road. I saw a lady on the ground with three men round her. I have identified those three; they are in the clock I rushed over to Mrs. Kinder and the men van off. I followed them. They went down one turning and I went down another. On my way I saw a constable and told him; then the constable ran; he saw the men run round the corner, then we followed them into the hay-loft in Kelso Place. There was a ladder leading up to the hayloft, When the constable came he went up. The three men came down and were arrested. I was about 50 yards off when the lady was knocked down. It was a bright day. I could see clearly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Tully-Christie. I could not see what the men were doing. I saw no other men in the road hut these three. Just as I turned the corner I taw a baker coming up the mews. Edwards</p>

               <p>and England were the two men I saw leave Mrs. Kinder when she was on the ground; the other one followed. I lost sight of them for a minute. I told the policeman as I was running along. By that time I was out of breath, but the policeman as he turned the corner saw prisoners, and I followed them up in the mews. I do not know what order they were running in.</p>
               <p>To England. I am sure you were on the ground with the lady.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">WALTER GRAY</hi>, 446 F. On October 15, about 3.20 p.m., I saw last witness running. He spoke to me. I saw prisoners, and ran after them. They went down Kelso Place and up a hayloft I went up after them. I asked what they were there for? Gibbs said "I heard a cry of 'Stop thief, a lady has been robbed.' "The other two said, "Yes, that is right, governor." I said, "I shall take the three of you into custody on suspicion of having robbed a lady in Victoria Road." They said, "All right, governor, we will go quietly" They came down. I called on two private persons to assist me to take them into custody. When, they were charged Edwards said, "I know nothing about it." The others mode no reply. I never saw Mrs. Kinder.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Tully-Christie. Gibbs made no difficulty about coming down from the loft or in going to the station.</p>
               <p>To Edwards. I do not remember you saying, "I am trying to assist the lady and the police."</p>
               <p>To England. I had my truncheon in my hand as I came up to the loft. You were not then coming down. The reason you were not charged until some six hours afterwards is that the lady was too ill; she had to be taken home.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). Last October I was em<lb/>ployed at Peacock Brothers, Brixton. I have not been in trouble be<lb/>fore. I have always borne a good character. I was in some road in Kensington, I do not know the name, on this afternoon, when a lot of people came running along. I ran with them. I heard that somebody had stolen something. I naturally van to see what it was. I ran into the hayloft. The other two prisoners were with me. (Edwards: I object to him saying that.) I was in the hayloft two or three minutes before to constable came. He said, "Something has been stolen off a lady." We then went to the station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have only spoken to England twice in my life. I do not know the other man, I was not near the place when the robbery happened. I know nothing about it. I went into the hay-loft because I had no better sense, I suppose.</p>

I ran with them round the corner; then we turned another corner till we got to the hayloft. I said, "Where have they gone?" Somebody said, "Up the loft." I entered the loft, and no sooner I got there up come the constables as far as the top of the steps and arrested me. I know nothing about the lady's purse. The lady said at the court she was not sure, and did not want to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The "we" I referred to are me and Edwards. (Edwards: I object; I was not with them; I was on my own.) Gibbs was not with us. I know bun by eight only—nodding. I am laughing because I am innocent. I never saw the lady at all. There were other beside us went into the loft. I did not count them. There were about six. I do not suggest that when the police searched me they found the letter and postcard and then put them in the loft. I cannot account for them being there.

On October 15 I was working for Sergeant Baker, of the X Division, Harrow Road, watching a certain fellow who did betting at a Willesden public-house. After I left Sergeant Baker I had to go to the infirmary at Kensington to tee an old chum who was slated. When I got to Victoria Road I beard somebody call "Stop thief" Naturally enough I thought I should join in the chase; it would be a job for me; I would get another reward. I have got it. I ran one way, others ran another. I dashed down these mews, and asked one of the witnesses if he see any man down there; he said, "Up in the loft." Naturally enough I goes up in the loft and get caught. Sergeant Baker could come here to prove I was working for him a week previous besides that.</p>

He might have seen me running, but not with the other prisoners. I know England a bit. He knows I work for the police. I have never seen Gibbs before in my life. There were a lot of men running; they were all over the shop. I was not there when Mrs. Kinder was knocked down. (Gibbs: He was with us.) I can honestly say I was not with these men; it is a wicked affair, and I wish the sergeant to read the statement I wrote.</p>

                  </hi>, widow, 65, Balfour Road, Ilford. Deceased, Florence Silles, was my sister. On March 17, 1906, she was married to Francis Cunningham Silles, who died on April 18, 1907. At the time of her death she was thirty-four years of age. She was an actress, fulfilling music-hall engagements under the name of Flo Dudley. I first met prisoner at the "Great Eastern Hotel" at the end of May last. My sister introduced me to him. Prisoner told me he had met her and had fallen in love with her. He was introduced to me as Mr. Hop<lb/>wood; he said he would very much like to marry her. He said he was managing director of a company called Commerce, Limited. I said I thought it was rather a risky business, and he laid it did not matter if the whole thing fell to the ground; he had plenty put by to live on comfortably with my sister when they should be married. I thought he was a single man. He used to visit my sister at my house. He said very often he wished her to give up the stage altogether, as it was not a nice life; he wished her to give up her contracts to him and he would pay all commissions and dues or demands on them, so that she could leave the stage en<lb/>tirely. All through their acquaintance marriage was spoken of</p>

                  </hi>, recalled. I have never received a letter from prisoner. A solicitor's clerk called at my house on September 13 with a letter for prisoner; he was not there, and the letter was left for him. I opened the letter and read it. Prisoner came on the 17th. I handed him the letter and said it was concerning worthless cheques that he had been presenting. I said it was terrible business for us. He said, "Anything I have done I will see through; this is Hosgood's doing." My sister said, "I know I have been very foolish; I must go back to my work." Prisoner said, "Don't do anything until you hear from me." Prisoner then went away in a taxi. I did not see him again until this case. My sister continued to live in my house. Exhibit 6 is a telegram which came for my sister on September 27. I went with her to the post-office to send the reply Exhibit 7. On. September 28 my sister left home about five o'clock in the afternoon. Exhibit 24 describes correctly the clothes she was wearing. I have since identified the clothes. I remember Sunday evening, September 27. Mr. Brebner called at my house about 8.30. My sitter was there and several of my children. He called again the next Monday about half-past seven; be left the house at about a quarter to eight with my sister to go to she Palladium. They got back about midnight. My sister had not seen him since last December; he is now abroad.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. You certainly showed affection for my sister, and you were very generous to her. I never saw any jealousy.</p>

The telegram Exhibit 37 is in prisoner's handwriting. To prisoner. You appointed me to be secretary of Commerce, limited; you were supposed to have paid my wages. I had had no experience of company work at all before; you always treated me as a friend, and you trusted me implicitly in connection with the affairs of the company. I did not know anything about Miss Dudley's affairs You confided in me your family affairs. I knew you were married and had three children. I have been to your flat at Street-ham.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010072"/>
               <p>You moved to Brighton last January. When you formed this company, Commerce, Limited, in. November, 1911, I was one of the signatories to the Memorandum and Articles of Association. You placed £1,500 fully paid shares in my name, and the £1,500 has been claimed from me by the liquidator of the company. I entered into a declaration of trust in respect of those 1,500 shares. I agreed is my declaration of trust to do all such acts and deeds as might be required of me upon notice being given to me in writing. I received a telegram from you on the 26th giving me notice that under my obligations in connection with that declaration of trust I was in<lb/>structed to attend the shareholders' meeting which was being held that day to wind up the company; you instructed me to vote on your behalf against the winding up. I attended the meeting; I did not use your vote at all. I took no notice of it; I voted for the winding up of the company. My object in thus voting was not to assist certain other people to acquire the benefits of the company for themselves. I never said that this shooting business had spoilt everything. There was nothing to spoil; it was already spoilt. I first saw Miss Dudley with you Some time in August, I think, at the "Inns of Court Hotel." When you were in Manchester and up north I met you at the St. Pancras Station, bringing letters with me. On one occasion in the middle of May I met you at St. Pancras Station at ten o'clock at night. You took a lady into the refreshment bar; I do not know who she was, and instructed me to go to the "Bedford Head Hotel." You did not tell me she was a theatrical lady; I did not remark that she Looked like a theatrical lady. I did not know she was fulfilling an engagement at Portsmouth that week. On the Saturday following I knew you were staying at Reading; I did not know whether you were staying with the lady or not. I was there with a Mr. Pater from the office at 86, Cannon Street. I was sent to see Mr. Loftus at the station; we were your guests at the hotel. I occupied a box with you at the theatre. I did not bear Miss Dudley sing. You told me to go and meet Mr. Loftus, and when I returned you told me the lady had just gone off. I took some luggage from Reading to Collins' Music-hall on the Monday; it was labelled "Dudley." I have seen Miss Dudley once or twice in a cab with you, and I have met her at Liverpool Street Station at your request. You knew at that time that your children were staying at Brighton. I have seen your children on several occa<lb/>sions; I knew that you wired money down each week to your daughter at Brighton, and I have taken money down. I knew you had not been living with your wife. You told me that Mrs. Hopwood had unexpectedly turned up at Brighton and in consequence you came and stayed in town. You told me that you never intended to live with Mrs. Hopwood again. You told me she was causing you a lot of trouble. Tine last time I went to Brighton for you was some time in July—I believe, a Saturday. When I saw you on the Sunday at the "Inns of Court Hotel" I told you that Mrs. Hopwood had left Brighton and taken the children away to Birmingham, and gave you the address where letters were to be sent. I made another communi<lb/>cation to you with regard to your daughter, and you said ii was a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010073"/>
               <p>terrible thing to hear, and that yon could hardly believe it. The landlady had told me that your daughter was going about with a coloured gentleman, and that Mrs. Hopwood was allowing it, and the landlady thought it should not be allowed; your daughter was a young girl of seventeen or eighteen. On July 29 I took a letter for you to Mrs. Bland. I read it in the train going down; you told me to read it. In that letter you made very bitter statements to Mrs. Bland about Flo. I knew you were worried.</p>

I was on duty at quarter to twelve that night. I saw prisoner again. I said to him, "Have you seen Madame?" He said, "She is in this refreshment bar," meaning the east-side buffet. He asked me to tell Jackson, an attendant in the bar, that he wanted to speak to her. I told Jack<lb/>son. I saw the lady in the bar with two gentlemen. After the pri<lb/>soner had spoken to Jackson I saw him on the bridge on the east side; from there he could see into the refreshment bar. I saw the lady come out of the bar with the two gentlemen; they had just missed one train and they went back into the bar again. I saw prisoner on the bridge and told him I was going down by the next train, 12.30. He asked me to watch the lady to see what station she got out at, and b gave me two shillings. The lady and the two gentlemen caught</p>

               <p>the 12.30 train. I went by that train to Maryland Point, which is two or three stations before Ilford. I did not see any thing of the lady or gentlemen. I do not know whether Jackson went by that train. The porter Turner came down with me in the same compartment. The next day, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw prisoner at Liverpool Street Station. I told him I did not see any more of the lady after leaving Liverpool Street, but that my mate (Turner) went to Ilford by the same train. I introduced Turner to prisoner and left them in conversation. On Saturday, Septem<lb/>ber 28, I saw prisoner at Liverpool Street in the evening between from and six. He asked me if I had seen Madame and would she be likely to travel from Fenchurch Street. There are trains from Fenchurch Street to Ilford. I told him I had not seen her.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I have known Miss Dudley five or six years. I have often seen you at the station to meet her and see her off. You were in the habit of asking me to watch which train she came by because you were not sure which train she might arrive by. Two months previous you told me that the lady was your wife. I have no idea why you should tell me that.</p>

                  </hi>, porter-guard, Liverpool Street Station. I know prisoner, and I know Miss Dudley by sight. On the night of September 23 I was at Liverpool Street Station when the last witness spoke to me, and I saw prisoner at about twenty past two in the morning. Prisoner asked me if I saw a lady get, out at Ilford on the previous evening. I told him I had. He said, "Who was with her?" I said, "Two gentlemen." He said, "Did you know them!" I said I knew one of them to be a Mr. McCullum; the other gent leman I did not know. I told him they left the train at Ilford. He asked me if they both got out, and I said "No, only the gentleman I did not know." I told him they took a cab and drove away from the station Prisoner has asked me several times at which platform trains arrive and at what time. I told him, and he wrote them on a piece of paper. Exhibit 41 looks like the piece of paper on which he wrote down the times of the trains and the platforms they arrived a Liver-pool Street Station.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I knew Miss Dudley very well for many years travel<lb/>ling up and down the line. I have spoken to you several times before the 24th. I told you I had seen the two gentlemen with Miss Dudley on the Monday, in the afternoon. I have never seen the other gentleman before.</p>

                  </hi>, porter at the East Buffet, Liverpool Street Station. I have seen prisoner there on many occasions during the post six months. I remember the night of September 21. Be<lb/>tween half-past ten and eleven I was in the buffet. I saw prisoner outside the door. He beckoned to me, and I went out to speak to him. He asked me if I had seen Madame that evening; I told him I had not seen her since the last time I saw her with ham in the bar. He said, "I have had a bit of a tiff with her and I hear she has been carrying on a fine game lately, and I am supposed to be in Manchester</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010075"/>
               <p>this week, but I am not going, as I am going to stay here and see if what I hear is right for myself." He told me he had recently been away for a holiday, and he had given her a good time and the best of everything, and he said, "This is how she serves me." He left the bar just after eleven. He came back the second time at about half-past eleven, I thank. While he was there Miss Dudley came in with another gentleman. I said to him, "Here is the lady you want." He said, "So it is," and immediately slipped out of the side door. I think she saw him; I could not say for certain. Whilst I was serving them Bolingbrooke came in and told me prisoner wanted me outside. He said, "Do you think the saw me?" I said "Yes, I do not think the could be on of feeing you." He said, "That's rotten; I did not want her to see me." He asked me to go, back into the bar and to see if I could hear what they were talking about. I went back into, the bar. He said he would see me later. I could hear the lady and gentleman talking, but could not hear what they were saying. I think the gentleman who was with her was wearing a navy blue suit. Another man joined them dressed in a light overcoat. All three left the bar together about 12.18 and returned shortly afterwards. I went off duty that night at 12.26. I changed my clothes and went out to the public part of the station, where I saw prisoner. He was standing on the platform, about twenty yards from the buffet. He told me they had just gone on to the platform, and he asked me if I would watch them and see what compartment they got into. He told me to watch them the other end to see if they got out at Ilford. I had pre<lb/>viously told him I lived at Ilford. He told me if I did what he asked he would give me a sovereign. I saw Miss Dudley and one of the gentlemen get out at Ilford; the other gentleman remained in the train. They took a four-wheeled cab and drove to Balfour Road; they both went into the house. I waited five or ten minutes, but nobody came out. On the 24th I went on duty at five past ten in the morning. I saw prisoner. He asked me the result of my watching, and I told him. He said, "Well, I am surprised. To talk to her you would not think she could do such a thing." He asked me to watch the trains coming up from Ilford. I told him I could not while on duty, but I would when I was off duty. In the afternoon he asked me if I had seen anything of her and I said "No." He told me if I saw her come off the train with a gentleman and go on the Underground or take a taxi anywhere I was to follow them, and if they went into en hotel or any private place I was to telephone to him at the "Great Eastern Hotel" and ask for Mr. Gordon, and he would follow immediately. He told me he wanted to catch her red-handed in a hotel or a private place with a gentleman, so as to prevent her from taking any action for breach of promise against him. I watched but I never saw her. I did not notice anything peculiar about pri<lb/>soner's manner; he always appeared the same. I next saw him on Saturday, September 28, at Liverpool Street Station just after 6 p.m. He asked me if I had seen Madame, and I told him I had not. He said, "I think she must have been coming up and dodging me by going to Fenchurch Street. He asked me to watch all the trains that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010076"/>
               <p>evening coming from Ilford: he said she had an appointment up West at seven o'clock. He said he would see me later.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I have seen Miss Dudley going up and down the line for the last four years. During the last six months previous to Sep<lb/>tember I have often seen you and Miss Dudley in the bar. When I followed Miss Dudley on September 23 to Ilford I made a mental note of what happened; I did not write it down. I told you that I had seen Miss Dudley on the Monday morning before she went down at night and I believe she was dressed the same as when she went down that night. I did not say when I followed Miss Dudley on the Monday night and the gentleman went into the house with her that I heard the door locked and bolted. When she addressed this gentleman in the bar the addressed him as Harry. You spoke to me, "Did she call him Harry and does he come from Birmingham?"</p>

                  </hi>, of C. and H. Weston, gunmakers, Brighton On September 26 prisoner came to my shop. He said be wanted a pistol, and I showed him some; he selected one. I asked him what he wanted it for, and he said he was going to Belfast where there were rows or disturbances going on, and he wanted something to put in his pocket, but he hoped he would never have cause to use it. I asked him if he had got a licence, and he said he had not. I told him I could not sell him a pistol without a licence. He went out and came back later in the day with a licence (Exhibit 1); the licence was taken out in Brighton on the same day. Then I sold him a pistol. He told me his name was Hop wood, address, "Inns of Courts Hotel," Lincoln's Inn, London. The pistol (Exhibit 2) is the one I sold him. It is called a Webley automatic pistol. I also sold him a small box of cartridges The pistol holds six cartridges and is operated by simply pulling the trigger; each empty cartridge case is ejected after each shot automatic<lb/>ally.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. This particular pistol was lying in the window with other revolvers where anybody could see it. You asked me for an auto<lb/>matic pistol. I showed you how to load the pistol and explained the working of it. It is the kind of pistol which is usually used by people going abroad; a little pocket pistol.</p>

They got in the taxi, and the gentleman: asked me the time of the last train to Ilford from Fen-church Street.

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD BUSBY</hi>, City Police. On September 28 I was on duty in Fenchurch Street, near Mincing Lane. I saw a cab going eastwards. I heard sounds of an explosion of some kind coming from a cab. I saw the cab pull up opposite 138, Fenchurch Street. By that tune I was on the pavement opposite the cab; I could see in the offs de window. I noticed a woman leaving the cab by the near aide door as if in a hurry. I ran across the road and saw the woman in the cabman's arms. I blew my whistle for assistance, and other constables arrived. I laid the woman on the footway; she was prac<lb/>tically unconscious. I knelt beside her; she never made any sign or spoke at all. Her clothing was disarranged. She was wearing the clothing produced. While attending to her I heard another shot from inside the cab. There were no other vehicles in sight. An ambu<lb/>lance came up and the deceased woman and prisoner were taken to the hospital. The property produced was taken from prisoner.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I had just turned into Fenchurch Street when the cab passed me. The cab stopped about fifty yards further down. When the cabman got out of his cab to examine his tyres I was about fifteen yards away. I saw the woman get out of the cab in a hurry I assisted her across the pavement; there was a wound in her neck and blood on her clothing. I got a few spots on my jacket. After I assisted her across the footway she said, "He has shot me," and she became unconscious.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM WAKELIN</hi>, 157, City Police. On hearing a police whistle I went to a taxicab which was pulled up opposite 138, Fenchurch Street. I approached the cab from the front of the foot<lb/>way on the same side as the cab. The near side door was open. I looked in the cab and saw a man sitting on the offside back seat. He had a revolver in his right hand resting on his knee. I heard the revolver go off. I dropped to the ground and went to the rear of the cab. Police-constable Butler came up and went to the off side of the cab. While he was doing that I heard another report from inside the cab. Butler placed his hand through the off side window and clasped the man's wrist and removed the revolver from his hand. We then searched the cab.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. As I approached the cab the near side door was open. I saw the lady lying on the pavement parallel with the shops. She was lying about 10 ft. to the rear of the cab. You were sitting on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010079"/>
               <p>the off side back corner of the seat, slightly inclined towards the near side door. The cab was pushed forward to allow the ambulance to move in. I believe there was another taxicab behind the cab you were in.</p>
               <p>Police constable <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN ZOLLNNER</hi>, 167, City Police. About midnight on September 28 I heard a police whistle; I went to a taxi, which was drawn up opposite 138, Fenchurch Street. I went to the near side door and opened the door as Butler took hold of the revolver in the right hand of the prisoner. Prisoner had a hat on. He was wounded on the forehead; he appeared to be dazed; shortly after taking hold of him he collapsed and fell forward on my shoulder. With the assis<lb/>tance of Police-constable Lygo I carried him out of the cab and laid him on the footway.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. You were sitting on the off-side back seat of the cab looking straight in front of you; your hat was on and the pistol in your right hand. I only heard one shot. I was on duty in Gracechurch Street; it would take about three minutes to walk from there to where the cab was. I saw the lady lying on the footway; the cab was slightly in front of her. I did not help to push the cab up; I did not see the cab moved; I only saw the one cab there.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK BUTLER</hi>, 123, City Police. I was in Cullum Street when I heard a police whistle; I went into Fenchurch Street and saw a taxicab pulled up opposite No. 138; I heard a report from a revolver from inside the cab; I was about seven or eight yards away at that time. I was approaching the cab from the front and went round to the off-side door; the window was open. I stepped on the footboard; I put both arms through the window, seized the prisoner's right forearm with my left hand and with the right hand I snatched the pistol from his right hand; he was holding it fairly tightly. Prisoner was taken out of the cab and I searched the cab. I found five empty cartridge cases on the floor of the cab. They are the same kind of cartridges as in the box (Exhibit 3). I found some bullets lying on the cushion on the centre of the back seat; I examined the cab for the purpose of seeing whether there was any sign of a struggle, but I could not see any; nothing was disarranged.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I was looking for empty cartridge cases; there was nothing whatever in the cab pointing to a struggle. You were sitting on the right side in the off-side corner in an upright position looking straight in front of you, with the pistol in your hand; I only heard one report, the cab was a little bit in front of the lady on the pave<lb/>ment; I did not see the cab moved whilst I was there. It is possible that while you were being taken out of the cab another cartridge may have been kicked out. I only found one spent ballet in the cab.</p>

In the early morning of September 29 I went to Fenchurch Street; opposite No. 138 I saw the taxi driver in charge of the cab. I examined the cab and found two holes in the cover and one through the glass. I found no sign of disorder, no signs of a struggle.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010080"/>
               <p>To prisoner. When I arrived there the ambulance had already left for the hospital. I noticed several distinct splashes of blood on the near tide footboard. There was a distinct hole in the glass of the window at the back of the cab; another one three inches above the glass; there was another hole on the near side of the hood, near the centre. I went to the hospital and took a list of the clothing of the deceased lady. I only received one glove; the right-hand glove was missing. The cab was kept at the Minories Police Station about 40 minutes and was then taken away by the driver. I did not examine the cab during that forty minutes. Inspector Rothwell authorised the cabman to take it away.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I saw Police-constable Poole examining the holes when he took his measurements; so far as I could tell the holes were exactly the same.</p>

                  </hi>, motor-cab driver. I was called to "Holborn Viaduct Hotel" on the night of September 28, about 11.45. A lady and gentleman got into the cab. It was directed to Fenchurch Street Station; there was no light inside the cab. Just before reaching Cullum Street I heard three reports in quick succession and the woman screamed; I thought reports were from the tyre; the woman's scream came from inside the cab. I got down, walked round the cab, and opened the near side door, and the woman got out of the cab, almost falling in my arms, She seemed to be excited to get out of the cab. I could see the outline of the man fitting on the off side back seat. I walked with the lady across the pavement towards the shop. A policeman came on the scene and blew his whittle, and we laid her on the pavement. After the lady got out I could not swear whether I shut tie door or not. After the woman left the cab I heard two sharp reports. I did not feel the cab rock at all before, pulling up. I did not feel or notice any sign of a struggle. I eventually took the cab to the Minories Police Station. I there saw two holes in the cover and one in the glass.</p>
               <p>To prisoner: When you gob into the cab the Lady got in first. There did not appear to be any quarrelling between you. I said at the inquest, "They appeared to be on friendly terms." It was rather dark inside the cab. When I first heard the reports I thought it was the tyres bursting. I walked round the back of the cab and examined the tyres. The lady fell into my arms. Her cheat was saturated with blood. I got a little blood on my coat. At I was assisting her across the pavement she said, "Mind, cabby. He's shot me; he has got a revolver. Take me to the hospital."</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY RIDER</hi>, 176, City Police. I went to Guy's Hospital on October 2 while prisoner was there.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010081"/>
               <p>I saw him again on the 3rd. He said, "The doctor did not tell me till last night that Flo was dead. It was her fault; she pressed my hand and got the dose. It was an accident for her, but not for myself."</p>
               <p>Chief Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN WILLIS</hi>, City Police. On October 4 I went with other officers to Guy's Hospital. I saw prisoner and told him we were police officers, and would take him to the police station for the wilful murder of Florence Alice Bernadetta Silles, otherwise Dudley, by shooting her with a pistol in. a cab in Fenchurch Street on Saturday, September 28, and further with Attempting to commit suicide. I cautioned him. He said, "So far as Flo was concerned, the whole thing was An Accident. She would never have been hurt herself if the had not interfered to prevent me committing suicide. So far as I am concerned, I intended at the moment to shoot myself." I conveyed him to the Minories Police Station, where he was formally.</p>

                  </hi> Cox, house surgeon, Guy's Hospital. I saw deceased shortly after midnight of September 28. She was uncon<lb/>scons. She died within ten minutes. Her clothing was not dis<lb/>arranged. I did not notice any scratches on her body. She had a wound in the head immediately in front of the ear, just above the lobe of the ear. There was also a wound behind the left ear. I afterwards found another wound at the back of the right shoulder. I examined her jacket and found a hole at a corresponding point behind the right shoulder. I made a post-mortem examination and traced the course of he bullet in her body. I found the bullet resting behind the heart and between the two lungs. It is a similar bullet to those in the box Exhibit 3. I inspected the cab and saw a bullet hole in the near side cover of the cab which corresponded with the wound in the woman's head. On September 29 I examined prisoner. He was suffering from concussion caused by a wound on the right side of the forehead. On October I be told me he had come up to town from Southampton. He said he had some dinner at the Holborn Restaurant with Flo and had several drinks. He said, "She said she was going to leave me, and I said if she did I would shoot myself. I was going to do this when she put her hand out to stop me, and it shot her instead." On the following day I told him Miss Dudley was dead. He said, "Good God," and he seemed very much upset.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. The wound in Miss Dudley's head is consistent with the statement you made to the chief inspector, that it was an accident. I have had experience of bullet wounds. You were unconscious till Monday morning. I believe you were under the impression that Miss Dr. dley was recovering. You were continually making inquiries as to how she was getting on. Miss Dudley was a strongly-built woman. the wound through the lung was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>Augusts <hi rend="smallCaps">JOSEPH PEPPER</hi>. B.M., F.R.C.S., consulting surgeon, St. Mary's Hospital. I have seen the clothing worn by the deceased woman, also the pistol and cartridges in the box. I have also examined taxicab I have Had considerable experience of the effects of pistol wounds on the human body. I have made experiments with this pistol and some ammunition. My opinion is that at the time the bullet wound in the head of the deceased women was caused the</p>

               <p>pistol was about 6 in. from her face. The wound on her head is consistent with the deceased having put out her hands to prevent prisoner shooting himself, but that is improbable. It is impossible that the bullet could have travelled through her head and also have gone through the cover of the cab.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath) detailed the circumstances of his meeting Miss Dudley and their subsequent relations. In con<lb/>sequence of his troubles he had determined to shoot himself, and it was for this purpose that he bought the revolver. On the night of the tragedy, as he and deceased were driving along Fenchurch Street she told him that she had finally decided to go back to the music hall stage. Upon that he said, "Well, then, I might as well end it all now," and pulled the revolver out of his pocket and shot at him<lb/>self on the left temple. It went off again and shot twice at the back of the cab. Deceased grasped his hand and said, "Teddy, put it down. I did not mean to leave you." She tried to twist his hand away and the wretched thing was going off. Unconsciously he was gripping it tightly. He shot her in the head. She yelled," Stop the cab. I am shot." She leaned to the door to open it. He was gripping this thing in his horror and it kept going off and it shot has again. He then shot at himself in the right temple. Deceased staggered out of the cab, saying," I am shot." As she fell down he shot himself in the temple and collapsed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have no letters in my possession from deceased which show that she knew I was a married man. I have no witness who ever heard Miss Dudley say that she knew I was a married man except Mr. Loftus, and he is unfortunately in New York.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a preeser in the employ of Anthony Clark and Co., mantle manufacturers. At 5.30 on November 20, I was in Buttesland Street, Hoxton, pulling a barrow containing 43 mantles and 19 costumes, when a man came up and asked me a ques<lb/>tion. While answering him I was struck and went to the ground. I cannot identify the person who struck me. I called to the prisoner Greenwood, who was on the pavement, for help, but he did not come to my assistance. The police came up while I was on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Jones. I did not say at the police court that I could recognise the man who struck me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Meredith. There was a lamppost about 25 yards away; it was rather dark at the time. The man who stopped me asked the way to Nile Street. I was pushed and kicked from behind. I did not say at the police court that there were two men in front and out behind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Greenwood. I could not say whether you refused to come to my assistance, but you did not come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Crathern. I did not see you there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Glynn. I let go of the barrow when I was struck because someone was cutting the rope. The barrow was swung round.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Although I cannot swear to him,' the man Meredith is something like one of the men.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANK PULLEY</hi>, G Division. I was in Pitfield Street, Hoxton, with Detectives Bell, Saville, and Tanner, at 5 p.m. on November 20, keeping observation on' prisoners, who were all together. I saw Meredith and Jones and another man, not in cus<lb/>tody, strike prosecutor, and then Jones and Crathern caught hold of the barrow and prosecutor dropped to the ground with the other men. Jones and Crathern seized the barrow and Glynn was at the back of the barrow. Glynn pushed the cover off the things on the barrow and tried to pull the garments off. Greenwood was on the footway oppo<lb/>site the barrow looking up and down the street. I heard someone say, "Kill him." I seized Greenwood, who fought desperately, till Detec<lb/>tive Bell struck him with his truncheon. Two other men attacked me from behind. On the way to the police station Greenwood said, "I am sorry I cut up. If I had known my pals had been going to out the bloke I would not have been in the job." Later, the five men were charged at the police station and Jones said, "Let Meredith go with me" Crathern said, "Let us all go together in the cells." On searching Meredith I took from him a pocket-knife and a knuckle<lb/>duster (produced). The other prisoners were arrested by the other officers I recognise them all as being five of the six men whom we had been watching.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010084"/>
               <p>To Meredith. You were the first man to go up to prosecutor, fol<lb/>lowed immediately by Jones and the other man.</p>
               <p>To Greenwood. We were all keeping you under observation. I do not know whether Detective saville heard you say you were sorry you cut up and that if you had known they were going to out the bloke you would not have been in the job.</p>
               <p>To Crathern. I have no doubt at all that I saw you at the side of the barrow with Jones.</p>
               <p>To Glynn. You were at the back of the barrow before Meredith went up to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE BELL</hi>. I was with Pulley and the other officers at about 4.45 on this evening, keeping observation on the pri<lb/>soners in Pitfield Street. Greenwood seemed to be keeping watch for the others. I saw him beckoning to them, and they all ran down Pitfield Street towards Buttesland Street, where I saw prosecutor poll<lb/>ing a barrow. Meredith, Crathern, and a man not in custody sur<lb/>rounded him and stopped him, and they all seemed to be delivering blows at him. I would not be certain that Crathern hit him. I saw Glynn after that at the back of the barrow trying to pull off a bundle of garments. Crathern and Jones pulled the barrow away from pro<lb/>secutor and slewed it round. I saw Greenwood there on the footway. and the next time I saw him he was in custody of Sergeant Pulley. with him. I struck him on the shoulder with my trun<lb/>struggling to restrain him. Then I looked round and saw Detective Tanner on the ground with Glynn, and I went up and struck Glynn with my trus<lb/>cheon. I then went to the assistance of prosecutor, who was in a dazed condition. At the police station I examined the rope which had held the bundles on the barrow and found it cut in two places. The cover had also been pulled off. I afterwards went to a coffee show in Hoxton and arrested Meredith, whom t had known before. He said he had been there all the afternoon.</p>
               <p>To Jones. I went first to the assistance of Detective-Sergeant Pulley.</p>
               <p>To Meredith. You aid not say to the other men in the coffee shop "Where have I been all the afternoon?" You said, "I have been all the afternoon."</p>
               <p>To Greenwood. I did not see you do anything to the prosecutor You appeared, in my opinion, to be keeping watch for the others.</p>
               <p>To Crathern. I would not be sure that I saw you strike the prose<lb/>cutor. I knew you by sight.</p>
               <p>To Glynn. I did not search you until after Detective Tanner had done so, so I cannot say whether knife was found on you or not. I struck you twice or three times to restrain you.</p>
               <p>Detective-Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE SAVILLE</hi> gave similar evidence to the other detective-sergeants as to keeping observation on prisoners and seeing them attack the prosecutor. I arrested Meredith and Jones and also caught hold of the prosecutor by mistake. I knew Meredith and Jones by sight. I arrested Jones at Sayers' coffee shop by the Parts of Fennlley and told him I was taking him into custody for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010085"/>
               <p>being concerned with others in robbery. I have known him by sight for six or seven years.</p>
               <p>To Jones. I did not say in the coffee shop," Come on, Fennelly, I want you," and you did not say" What for?"</p>
               <p>To Meredith. I was about 12 yards away from the barrow when the prosecutor was assaulted. (To the Court.) I have known Meredith for about seven years.</p>
               <p>To Greenwood. I have no doubt that you ran from Pitfield Street to Buttesland Street.</p>
               <p>To Crathern. You were on the right-hand tide of the barrow and turned it round. To Glynn. I did not know you before and have not said I did. I saw you at the back of the barrow trying to pull the clothes off it. I did not see you cut the rope.</p>
               <p>Detective-Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD TANNBR</hi>. I was with the other officers. I recognise all the prisoners and have known Jones, Meredith, and Greenwood for about five years. I know Crathern and Glynn by sight. Meredith and the man not in custody fell to the ground with the prosecutor. Glynn was standing at the back of the barrow. He took a pocket knife from his pocket and cut the rope. I saw him open the knife and was actually trying to pull the things off when I arrested him. The rope had been cut in two places. I charged him with robbery with violence. I took Glynn to the police station, where he was detained and subsequently charged. Inspector Rawlinson took the charge. I arrested Crathern at the coffee shop, where I found him crouching behind a seat. When he saw me he said, "So you want me, sir?" and when I told him the charge he said, "I haven't had anything." At the station he said, "I have had no food all day, I am nearly starving. I must do something." A knife was found in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>To Meredith. I did not see you do anything; you were there stand<lb/>ing on the pavement.</p>
               <p>To Crathern. I admit that you had 6s. 8d. in your pocket when yon were searched at the police station.</p>
               <p>To Glynn. I did not find a knife in your possession when you were searched; I suppose you got rid of it in the struggle.</p>
               <p>(Tuesday, December 10.)</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">FRIDIRICX BEAWSCOMBE</hi>. About four o'clock on the afternoon of November 20, I saw the five prisoners at the corner of little Essex Street. I moved them on and followed them for some distance. I next saw them again when I returned to the police station at about six o'clock that evening.</p>
               <p>To Greenwood. It would be about five minutes' walk from where I first saw you to where the assault took place on the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM RAWLIMSON</hi>, Q Division. I entered the charge against prisoners at Old Street Police Station on November 20 on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010086"/>
               <p>charge-sheet produced. The preliminary hearing was before Mr. Chester Jones.</p>
               <p>To Jones. I was not in the station when prisoners were brought in I saw no marks of violence on prosecutor, but he was very much shaken and very nervous.</p>
               <p>To Meredith. I believe Police-constable Branscombe said he had seen you before you were arrested.</p>
               <p>To Glynn. I do not remember asking prosecutor if he would like to be examined by a doctor.</p>

While I was walking towards the Bitfield Free Library a man whom I knew as Wiggie came up to me and asked me to come with him and earn some money. I went with him and saw some men—not the prisoners—round the prosecutor. I was about to take some garments off the barrow as suggested by Wiggie when I was arrested.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were some more boys there whom Wiggie must have known, but they had gone on in front. (To the Recorder.) Wiggle disappeared, and I did not know where he went. I had not a knife at the time.</p>

We stood outside for half an hour talking, and then he went inside again. I am now living at home and am not in work. I have seen Meredith since he has been in prison. I have heard some of the evidence he has given in this case. I have not got my hospital card with me which would have the date on it.</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">PERCY GROVES</hi>, 127 C. At 4.45 a.m. on Novem<lb/>ber 24 I saw prisoner coming out of Sackville Street into Vigo Street. She was carrying a large package. I went after her and asked what she had got. She said, "These are my lady's things; I am going to mind them for her." I said, "That is not a satisfactory explanation. Unless you can account for them better than that I shall take you into custody." on She said, "I will give you my name and address; it is quite all right." I said, "That is no good to me; I shall take you into custody on suspicion that they are stolen." With that she threw the box in the road and ran away. I went after her and caught her; the became very violent; she said, "I do not want to go to prison for this." I took her to the station. On the way there she said, "A Jewess gave them to me in Sackville Street." She dropped down on the way to the station on four different occasions on to her knees; each time she dropped an article. At the station she said, "Two Jaws, a man and a woman, were quarrelling about the things; the man gave them to the woman and said, 'Take them; I am not going to be blamed for it.' I was passing; the woman pushed them into my</p>

               <p>hands; she said, 'You can have these; I am clearing out my place." I went to No. 8, Sackville Street, which address was on the box; there I found the window had been forced from the outside. The gate, which was locked, had mud on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I first spoke to prisoner about 30 yards up Savils Row, on the opposite side to Sackville Street. She looked a bit frightened.' On the way to the station she said, "There she is down there now." That was Sackville Street. I looked to see if there was any<lb/>body, but there was not. She tried hard to get away, hit me with as umbrella and threw herself down. It was a wet night; it was not raining then, but it had been. Each time she fell something fell from under her cloak.</p>

                  </hi>, matron, Vine Street Police Station. I searched prisoner. She was wearing this green coat under a long velvet cost I found a pocket, which she said was her market pocket, a knife, a front door key, and a torch. She said a Jewess had given them to her.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY BARNACLE</hi>, C Division. I was at Vine Street Police Station at 5.40 a.m. on November 24, shortly after prisoner was brought in. I went to 8, Sackville Street. I found marks on the box of the gate, which was secured by a padlock and chain, as if some body had climbed over. One of the area windows had been forced; there were marks on the yellow painted fastening which would be made by the sharp edge of the knife blade. I found the place strewn with things similar to what I had seen at the station, and one large bundle was ready for removal. Prisoner said the coat (Exhibit 5) was hers. I heard she had been wearing the coat with the big pocket; it was perfectly wet; it was raining as I came on duty.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). The things were pushed into my arm and the woman ran after this man she was quarrelling with. I did not know what to do. Some were strewn over the floor and some on the railings. The woman was carrying some of the things and the man the box; she threw the coat on the front railings, I thought I had better bring them along to the court. The box was loosely done up. I could not get all the things into it, so I put these into my own pocket. That was in Sackville Street. This is the first charge that has been brought against me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am employed by Jones, 15, Bolsover Street. I live at Munster Square. I was out late that night because I had seen a friend home. I did not hurry because I live by myself, and it</p>

               <p>does not matter what time I get In. I was out for no bad purpose. I had a good sleep before I came out. I left home soon after 12. I met my friend by accident. She was in service at Brixton. I had not seen her for about two years. I put the coat on because there was no room in the box, and covered it over with my own cloak because I thought I would have to account for that if they had been stolen. I was going to take them to the nearest police station. I did not tell the officer I was minding them for my mistress; that is a lie; and I did not run away. I ran round the corner within sight of the officer to see if I could catch sight of this woman. I did not fling the box; I dropped it. I was faint and tired; I could not hold the box.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FITZGERALD</hi>, C Division. I have made inquiries about this young woman. She has been employed as a tailoress since July last. On the Saturday previous to her arrest she received £1 wages. Mr. Jones has always found her straightforward and honest.</p>

               <p>Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">MAY MORGAN</hi>. I have a bedroom on the ground floor at 37, Brunswick Square. On November 12 my room was unlocked as the cleaner was coming to clean the windows. I had some jewellery in a drawer of my dressing table. I last saw it at 10 a.m. I saw prisoner just before 3 p.m. I asked him whether he had been in my room; he said" No." I asked if he was going in there next to clean the windows; he said" Yes." I did not know that I had lost my jewel<lb/>lery till 3.15. The value of the property I lost was £10.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know what time he came to the house—A few minutes before three he was cleaning the dining-room windows. I said at the police court," Afterwards I entered my bedroom, the window had been cleaned." I was not permitted to say one half was cleaned and the other was not; I was asked questions mostly and had to answer yes or no. I know he entered my room because I heard the windows opened.</p>

Prisoner was employed by us in January and March, 1911. We try to find Army and Navy men. I cannot tell you if prisoner is one of them. Our books show that prisoner was sent to 37, Brunswick Square on November 12. I do not know what time he arrived back; I was at Maidenhead that day. The people were not satisfied with the work he did; they sent the following day to say the windows were not properly cleaned, and some were not touched.</p>

The clerk in charge gave me a list of four places. The last place I did was Brunswick Square I got there at 12.45. When I had cleaned the windows the maid signed the paper. She asked if all the windows were cleaned; I said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010091"/>
               <p>"As far as I know." I left about 3.15. I had worked all my dinner four. I went and had a sandwich and a glass of ale a pot my leather and bucket outside the public-house. I need not have got back till six; I got back at 4.15. I gave the clerk the billheads and said, "Would you mind me having 2s. sub." He said, "Wait a minute." I stood on the steps when in walked two police officers in plain clothes. One of them said, "Is your name Crew?" I said "Yes." He said, "Have you been to 27, Brunswick Square cleaning windows?" I said "Yes." I was taken to the station. After I had tat there two hours I was charged. I was asked to turn my pockets out if I was an honest man. They said they had turned my place over and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The public-house where I had dinner is four minutes from my job. That is the only public-house I went into that afternoon. The officer said I told him another public-house; that is a mistake.</p>

We had been drinking, and about 10.30 we went into the "Crown" public-house, Battersea Park Road. There was a bit of a row on, but I could not say what about. My brother William who was there went out, and another man followed him. Neither Galvin, William Jones, nor I took part in the row. The landlord came over the bar, took our beer away, and turned us out of the house. When I got outside I saw my brother William fighting with a man named Lambert on the other side of the road. At that time Galvin was standing on the pavement talking to five or six other men. I crossed the road, and when I came back I saw Galvin lying on his back.</p>

                  </hi>, divisional surgeon, Battersea Police Station. Deceased (Galvin) was brought in at about a quarter past eleven on the night in question, and after examining him I had him placed in an observation cell. He was suffering from compression and contusion on at the back of the head. He was sensible, but was very drunk. I was again fetched to him at 3.30 on the Monday mon<lb/>ing, the 14th, and found him in an epileptic fit, and with a black eye so fearing some compression of the brain I sent him to St. John's Hill Infirmary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. An epileptic fit may be brought on by pressure on the brain or diseese, and if a man were subject to it drink would bring it on.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. A man would not get a black eye immediately he was struck.</p>

                  </hi>, medical superintendent, St. John's Hill Infirmary. Deceased was admitted at about five o'clock in the morning of October 14. He was dazed and drowsy, and had severe pain in his head. His right eye was black and he had signs of a head injury. He remained in the same condition until the Wednesday night, when He became comparatively lucid. On the Thursday he was rational, but in the evening he had a relapse and dried on Satur<lb/>day, the 19th. I held a post-mortem examination and found the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010093"/>
               <p>cause of death was two fractures at the base of the skull, one of which passed through one of the large blood sinuses, and there was bleeding on to the surface of the brain. The fracture could have been caused by a fall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A fracture such as the deceased had would not cause a black eye.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANCIS PEARCE</hi>. I arrested prisoner on Octo<lb/>ber 21. I cautioned him and told him he would be charged with killing the deceased. He made a statement to me. (To the Re<lb/>corder.) He did not say he struck the man in self-defence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I believe prisoner sent a friend to tell me where so find him and arrest him.</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">FRANK PYKE</hi>. I found prisoner detained at Marlborough Street Police Station and arrested him for the man<lb/>slaughter of Galvin. He made a statement to me. He made no reply to the charge. On October 22, at the South-Western Police Court, when I proposed to put prisoner up for identification, he said he did not wish it, as he did not deny pushing Galvin down after Galvin hit him.</p>

                  </hi>, 29, Archway Street, Barnes, motor omni<lb/>bus conductor, badge No. 8549. On Tuesday, October 22, about mid<lb/>day. I was conducting a bus going from the Bank to Barnes, via Charing Cross. At the Mansion House Sir Thomas Crosby, the late Lord Mayor, got in; prisoner got in immediately after. At Charing Cross prisoner and Sir Thomas Crosby stood up to get out. Another man stood in the doorway and looked up the staircase; I told him to get out of the way; he inquired if the bus went to Piccadilly. I said "Yes," and he sat down again. Prisoner was standing behind Sir</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010094"/>
               <p>Thomas Crosby, who alighted and said to me, "I protest agains this man pushing me inside the bus," referring to prisoner, why walked away. A gentleman inside the bus, whose name I now know to be Bennett, made a communication to me. On November 12, a Bow Street Police Station, I picked prisoner out from a row of nine or ten other men as being the man who was in the bus.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have been working regularly on my bus since carrying between 400 and 500 passengers a day. I did not see any<lb/>body assault Sir Thomas Crosby or attempt to take his pin; if that was done it must have been done by a man behind him and not by the man in front, who had his back to him. When I went to Bow Street Police Station to pick out the man I had seen in the bus I cannot say there were any men in the row like prisoner; I would pick out the man I thought most like him. I had a good look round before I picked him out because I hardly liked to say he was the man before I had a good look at him—I thought I might make a mistake. I was sure when I picked him out. Prisoner was wearing a light cost on October 22.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When I saw the prisoner in the row I had a little doubt at first; I have no doubt now.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS BOOR CROSBY</hi>, late Lord Mayor of London. As I was getting out of the bus at Charing Cross I was hustled about by some one behind me and abused in filthy language for not moving out of the bus. I said, "You can see yourself the reason I cannot get out—because the people are getting down from the top." Immediately I was pushed forward from behind, and someone behind me struck me on the back of the hand, rupturing a blood vessel, which is not well yet. The man behind me followed me out of the bus, uttering all kinds of epithets against me. He was wearing a fashionable drab coat, Next morning I noticed that a pin, worth from £30 to £50, which I had been wearing on October 22, was damaged. On November 5 I went to Bow Street Police Station to pick out prisoner, but I failed to identify him. I challenged another man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw no one attempt to take my pin.</p>

                  </hi>, 137, Crompton Road, West Dul<lb/>wich, furniture manufacturer. At Charing Cross Station Sir Thomas Crosby, the prisoner, another man, and myself got up to get out of the bus. Prisoner was behind Sir Thomas, the other man was in front I saw prisoner with his fight hand holding a folded newspaper under Sir Thomas Crosby's chin and with his left hand pulling at his tie-pin. Prisoner stared at me and jumped out of the bus. I spoke to the con<lb/>ducter. On November 4 I went to Bow Street Police Station and picked prisoner out from a row of eight or nine men as being the man I had seen pulling at the tie-pin. (To the Jury.) I did not stop prisoner because I could not collect my thoughts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner had a light suit on; I would not say it was similar to that which he is wearing now. There was not any great resemblance between the prisoner and the man Sir Thomas Crosby picked out at the police station. Prisoner was put up for identifica<lb/>tion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010095"/>
               <p>among men of the same style as himself; I should not say there were any like him.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">CECIL BISHOP</hi>, New Scotland Yard. On Novem<lb/>ber 4 at 12.40 I saw prisoner in company with another man in Liver-pool Street. I walked up behind prisoner, caught hold of him, and said, "I want you." He said, "Damn you," and became violent. I conveyed him to the police station and informed him he was wanted on a warrant for assaulting with intent to rob. He said, "Who it it that I am supposed to have done over?" I said, "The Lord Mayor, Sir Thomas Crosby." He said "Oh, is it? He is a magistrate, too. Well, I suppose they will give me a proper identification. I still stand a chance, don't I?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was in plain clothes when I arrested prisoner. Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GOUGH, E</hi> Division. On November 4, at 5 p.m., I saw prisoner in custody at Bow Street Police Station and told him I held a warrant for his arrest, which I read to him. He said, "Am I to be put up for identification?" He was afterwards put up for iden<lb/>tification. He asked to be allowed to take his overcoat off. As all the other men had overcoats of a similar kind, I refused. He was identified by Bennett; I asked him if he was sure. When charged I do not think prisoner made any reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Sir Thomas Crosby unhesitatingly picked but another man and said, "That is the man." Verdict,

                  </hi>, cashier, Capital and Counties Bank, High Hol<lb/>born. At about 9.15 a.m. on November 19 prisoner presented this cheque for £160, payable to Samuel Coombes, signed by W.P. Marler. I was suspicious and asked him if he came from Mr. Coombes; he said he did; I asked him where he was going to take it; he said he was going to meet Mr. Coombes at Victoria Station. I asked him to put his name and address on the back of the cheque; he signed "Frank Underwood, 28, Percy Street." He asked me if the cheque was all</p>

When we got back to the bank I asked pri<lb/>soner what he had to say. He said, "I admit it; it was given me by a man at Victoria Station."

                  </hi>, 55, Baldwin Street, City Road, porter. Between 10.30 and 10.40 p.m. on October 29 I was in Bonner Street I saw prisoners in the doorway of Messrs. Pfenigstein, furriers. I next saw them go towards Bunhill Row. In Featherstone Street they went into the doorway of Messrs Darnall, wholesale stationers. I passed them in City Road and spoke to a postman, then came back. The postman went round into Old Street and through to Mallow Street. I saw prisoners standing in the same doorway in Mallow Street. I passed right through, left the postman on the corner of Mallow Street, and went into City Road again towards Old Street, where I saw the same three in Stillwell's doorway. I did not notice what they were doing. The woman's face was to the door and the men were side by side, one looking the way of the street and the other the other way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Purcell: I left my work at 7.30. These were all busy streets but one. I did not see a policeman. I did not look carefully for one. I have seen the postman several times since Prisoners were strangers to me. I did not see them arrested. I went to the police station the following week. I did not give my name and address to anybody but the postman. I was asked if I could pick the men out; I said I could if they wore the same clothes. In conse<lb/>quence of having said that I was not shown the men among others. I did not see prisoners do anything, but I thought they were after something dishonest.</p>

I saw the three prisoners on the corner of Featherstone Street and Mallow Street. I saw the woman go up the steps of Messrs. Darwin; Nye was at the bottom of the steps; Poole stood a little way from the steps and repeatedly looked first up Mallow Street and then up Featherstone Street. They were there five minutes or more; then they went towards Old Street. They went in the doorway of Stillwell and Sons; the female faced the door the men stood side by side to the woman's back, close to the doorway, They were there several minutes, then went towards City Road. I turned into Old Street and walked after them. They stopped on the corner of Old Street and City Road and looked all ways; I think the saw me and got on a horse tram going towards the City. I had seen a</p>

               <p>postman in Featherstone Street who made a communication to me. I fol<lb/>lowed the tramcar as beet I could and got as far as Chiswell Street, where Poole was leaning against a post. When I went towards him he stood up from his leaning position and gave a low whistle, looking down Finsbury Street. I passed him and saw Nye and Wilson standing together in the centre of the footway about halfway down Finsbury Street. I passed right by, some distance, and stood on the corner of Hilton Street and Chiswell Street. In a minute or two Poole passed me and went towards Whitecross Street, some 50 or 60 yards. There he stood on the kerb. By that time Wilson and Nye passed me and looked in every bar at the "St. Paul's Head," on the corner of Milton Street. Poole turned and joined them. They all went into the same bar and conversed together. I then obtained assistance and waited for them to come out, which they did in about 10 minutes. Wilson and Nye came out first. I told them to wait a moment till Poole came. When Detective Gill brought him I told them I should take them into custody as suspected persons loitering. Wilson said to Nye, "This is what you got me out for; I thought it would come to this, you tricky b—; they have got you at last." I do not know what Nye said; all three prisoners were talking at one another while we were Wiring them away. I took Nye. He made no reply when charged.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">ERNEST HALLETT</hi>, 212 Q. At 11.30 on October 29 I was in Old Street. I saw prisoners at the corner of Mallow Street and Featherstone Street. They saw me and left there. They afterwards returned to the same place, Darwin's. I watched them for a few minutes I saw them leave the corner, cross the road, and the woman went into the doorway of Withers and Withers. She came out imme<lb/>diately afterwards. Prisoners then came towards, me and stopped at Stillwell's doorway. The two men got in front of the woman and I could see part of the woman's back. She was facing the doorway; the men were facing the street. They stopped there a few minutes, and I left the corner as I saw police-constable 140 coming round Mallow Street. He followed them to the corner of City Road and Old Street. He came back and told me something, and I went down Bunhill Row to Chiswell Street where I again met him. Soon afterwards pri<lb/>soners were taken into custody as they left the public-house in Chiswell Street. Wilson said to Nye, "This is what you have got me out for; I thought it would come to this, you tricky b—; they have got you at last." I did not hear Nye or Poole say anything in reply to that.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR GILL, G</hi>. I saw prisoners converting together in the public bar of the "St. Paul's Head," Chiswell Street. Nye and Wilson came out first, followed by Poole about 15 yards behind. Police-constable 140 stopped Nye and Wilson. Poole, on seeing that, turned hurriedly in the direction of Bunhill Row. I went after him and overtook him. I said, "I am a police officer and I want you to come back to Chiswell Street with me." He said, "What for?" I said, "I will tell you when you get there." I took him back to where the other prisoners were detained. I said to all three, "You will he taken to the City Road Police Station and charged with being cus<lb/>pected</p>

               <p>persons loitering for the purpose of committing a felony." Poole said, "And you have made a bloomer." When charged they made no reply.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I had been out all day on October 29. I had got my stock money on me and was going to take it to the man I am working with. I had to take it to a turning of Bath Street, City Road. I got on a tramcar outside the "Mtro<lb/>politan, "Clerkenwell Road, and got off at City Road about 11.35, when I met Wilson. I knew her before this evening. She asked me to go home with her. I said yes. Instead of getting on the tras at the corner of Old Street to go home I asked her to go the other was about, to save my wife or anybody seeing me. That is how we come to get round by Chiswell Street. In Chiswell Street I went down the turning with the female while Poole was at the top. Poole came to Farringdon Road about 7.30 and stopped with me till he got arrested When I came back with the female we were having a bit of an arge<lb/>ment. Poole said, "I am going to leave you if you are going to row." We walked up Chiswell Street into a public-house on the corner. When we come out Poole said, "You are still rowing; I am going home He left us, while we went the other way to get to Farringdon Street, When we got four or five yards me and Wilson were arrested. We had not been in any doorways; it was down a gateway in Chiswell Street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not hear Poole whistle. Police-constable Danes's evidence as to the events that happened from the time I get on the tram with the woman till we were arrested is true. Everything before that time is false.</p>
               <p>No evidence was offered for Poole.</p>

               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JOSEPH GILLARD</hi>, E division. At 10.40 a.m., on October 31, I went to 30, Hanforth road, Kennington, in company with Detective Wiltshire. I knocked at the door, which was opened by a women. I went in; at the sitting-room door on the first floor front I saw prisoner. I said, "we are police officers and are going to arrest you on suspicion of being concerned with Duncan Browne, alias Robinson, of No. 2, Peter street, Earl's Court Road, who is in custody, for making and possessing counterfeit Bank notes and counter<lb/>feit coin at that address." Wallace said, "I had better say nothing." I immediately searched him, but found nothing in his possession. I then proceeded to search the room. In a bag in the corner of the room, with in two yards of where Wallace was sitting at the time, I found a purse containing 19 counterfeit sovereigns (produced). I was about to count them when the prisoner interposed and said, "I think you will find 19 there." I also found in that room two electric bat<lb/>teries and four parts of an automatic stamping machine used for frank<lb/>ing letters, which the prisoner spoke of as a patent of his. I conveyed prisoner to the police station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I cannot say whether these batteries (produced) are used in the manufacture of counterfeit coin. I went to see your wife in your interest to ask her if she could tell me the name of anyone you had worked for. I do not think she is a robust women, but she did not appear to be ill.</p>

                  </hi>, caretaker, Warwick Chambers, Peter Street, Earl's Court. For six to eight weeks a man named Robertson, whom I have since heard called Browne, occupied No. 4, Warwick Chambers. During that time prisoner visited him several times. Browne then moved in to No. 2, Warwick Chambers; Wallace and another man helped him to move in. Wallace also called on him the next day.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I know of nothing wrong going in No. 4; the police raided No. 2. I have seen you fitting up the gas at No. 4. I did not see you call on Browne after the second day after he had moved into No. 2. Browne moved towards the end of September.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010102"/>
               <p>After Browne moved I showed No. 4 flat to likely tenants and examined it; I saw no signs of coining having been carried on there. It was simply an ordinary domestic flat. At the previous trial (see page 107) I gave the same evidence against you as I am giving now; the verdict was Not guilty.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Prisoner was tried and acquitted then on a charge of forging bank notes.</p>

After Browne had moved into No. 2 Wallace returned a gas ring and stove which we had lent to Browne. On October 18 I saw a machine taken into No. 2 in different parts; I saw that same machine taken out by the police on October 30.</p>

During August and September, Browne, of 2, Warwick Chambers, which is opposite our shop, was one of our customers. When be came to our shop he was always acom<lb/>panied by prisoner. They bought from us solder, tin, and copper. They brought to us two machines (produced) to be mended. They appear to have been used for milling. Prisoner paid for the repairs. To prisoner. One of these machines appears to be part of a tele<lb/>phone; I do not know whether the other is such as is used for winding spiral springs. You always gave the instructions and paid. The second repair we have not been paid for. I referred to these machines at the last trial, but the judge stopped me. Browne always came it with you; I suppose he came in to look after you.</p>

On October 30, at about 1 p.m., I and other officers searched No. 2, Warwick Chambers The flat consisted of four rooms. In the first room we found 63 sovereigns in a brown paper parcel, a watch case containing nine sovereigns and 10 half-sovereigns, a box containing 38 sovereigns not gilded, and 25 sovereigns wrapped in paper, all counterfeit. We found in Room No. 4 a stone jar containing 32 half-crowns and another stone jar containing 125 sovereigns, all counterfeit. We also found a coin tester, bottles of ammonia, citrate of magnesia, lime, turpen<lb/>tine, nitric acid, permanganate of potash, a plaster of paris mould for making sovereigns, a mould for making half-crowns, a parcel of broken</p>

               <p>To prisoner. Sometimes information is given to the police for motives of revenge or for a monetary consideration. I found a penny-in-the-slot machine at Browne's flat; I have not taken possession of it or produced it here, because I do not think it is material to this case. I believe you are an inventor and patentee and the owner of several patents. You have been in custody since your arrest on October 31. I made inquiries at your addresses and have heard unfavourable reports concerning you. One address you left early in the morning without paying rent.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). I do not give evidence upon oath because I have been for seven weeks in prison, during which time I have been 23 out of every 24 hours in the cell, and am not in a fit state to stand cross-examination. I have known Browne for 15 years, although I have not kept up the acquaintance with him all that time. As I thought he might know people who would buy my patents I went into partnership with him and removed into No. 2, Warwick Chambers, a penny-in-the-slot machine which I have invented. I was not there when any. of these implements for the manufacture of coun<lb/>terfeit coin were there. Browne, knowing I was an electrical engineer, asked me to mend the two little machines (produced). I said I over not because there were no tools. Browne said, "Will you come over with me to the ironmongers and explain to him how they are to be put in?" I did so. If they were used for the manufacture of con<lb/>terfeit coin it was quite unknown to me. My association with the flat was an absolutely innocent one. I generally call every night at 48, Old Compton Street, which is an accommodation address of mine, where I receive letters. Just before my arrest I had been receiving a lot of letters from the General Electric Company. I called there on October 30, picked up the letters and parcels which had come for me, took them to 30, Handforth Street, and did not look at them until next morning, half an hour before the police arrived. I thought they were counters and somebody was playing a joke with me. I threw them down carelessly, where they were found by the police. The electric batteries I have had for 18 months; I use them for my electric bells at home. As to my association with the flat, all the evidence was given concerning it at the previous trial and I was acquitted.</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS TONGUE</hi>, 226 E. About 9.45 p.m. on Octo<lb/>ber 26 I was on duty in plain clothes in Southampton Row, Holborn, where I saw prisoners in conversation. Binden handed something to Davis. Davis left the other two and went to a tobacconist's shop at 140, High Holborn. The others followed him as far as Southampton Street. When Davis came out he joined the others and handed some thing to Binden. Then they all walked eastwards, along High Hol<lb/>born.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191212010105"/>
               <p>I followed them to Farringdon Road. They all entered a public-house. When they came out they all went to Old Street. There Binden handed something to Harding and the other two stood in a public-house doorway opposite No. 13, Old Street. Harding entered 13, Old Street, a chemist's shop, and came out shortly after<lb/>wards, walked along Old Street, and some distance along Old Street the other two prisoners rejoined him. Harding gave something to Binden. I then followed them all to Pitfield Street, where Binden gave something to Davis, who went into an eating-house at 10, Pitfield Street. The other two stood on the opposite side of the road. Davis walked along to the "Crosby Head" public-house, where the other two met him. They all entered the public-house. When Davis rejoined the other two he handed something to Binden. I obtained the assistance of two uniformed constables and entered the same bar as prisoners. Before I went to the "Crosby Head" I went to 10, Pit<lb/>field Street, where the proprietress handed me a counterfeit half-crown (Exhibit 1). In the "Crosby Head" I said to prisoners, "I am a police officer and am going to arrest you for being concerned together in uttering counterfeit coin." Harding said, "What are you talking about?" and at the same time dropped a counterfeit half-crown (Exhibit 2) on the floor of the bar. It was picked up by Police-constable 243 G. I took Davis back to 10, Pitfield Street. When we entered the shop the proprietress said, "That is the man." They were all taken to the station and charged. They made no reply to the charge. They were searched by Police-constables 243 and 217 and myself. On Davis I found one pair of new socks, a box of matches, and a pawn ticket. I afterwards went to 140, High Holborn, on October 28, where the proprietor handed me Exhibit 10.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the chemist's shop at 90, South<lb/>ampton Row. On October 26, between 9 and 9.30 p.m., Davis came in and asked if I kept chewing sum. He bought three-pennyworth tad tendered a half-crown. I told him I did not like the look of it; he asked why; I told him it was a bad one and rang it on the counter. I also weighed it against a good one and gave it back to him to look at. He said he knew where he got it from. He then gave me a good half-crown and I gave him the change. I identified him from a number of men at Old Street Police Station on October 28.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Harding. You did not took surprised when I gave you the coin, or run out of the shop. You did not stop there looking at it and ringing it.</p>

They are labelled with our name and address. They cost a penny a box. He gave me a half-crown in payment. On Monday, the 28th, I received a communicate from the police and examined the money in the till. There was then only the half-crown and some change. I had cleared the till on Saturday night before the man came in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jarvis. I identified Davis as the man who bought the pills. That was at the police court.</p>

I put the coin on the counter and afterwards put it in my pocket with other money, Shortly afterwards a police officer came in. He afterwards returned with Davis, when. I at once said, "This is the man that gave me the half-crown."</p>
               <p>To Mr. Jarvis. I gave the change out of my pocket. I think it was a two-shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Davis. You might have had supper at my place every night and said good evening and good night; it is very likely. When the officer came to the shop my husband said, "I think the half-crown is a good one." My husband did not see you come in the first time; he was in the cellar. (To the Court.) I do not know if he was there when the officer brought the man back.</p>

On November 8, accompanied by Sergeant Goodwillie and Detective Nicholls, I went to 8, Frederick Street, Stratford, and there saw prisoner. We said we were police officers and had reason to believe that counterfeit coin were being made there. She said you will find it all upstairs. In a top floor room we found on a table four plaster moulds with the coin in them hot; by the side were 14 counterfeit florins; on the fire was a pot with hot metal in it. (The four moulds with a florin in each were pro<lb/>duced.) Prisoner's apron bore traces of a white substance and her hands were very black. In the room we also found 108 other counter<lb/>feit florins (produced), a quantity of silver sand, files, scissors, black<lb/>ing, antimony, and other paraphernalia of coining. At this time prisoner was alone in the house. Later Sims came in; we told him what we had found; he said, "My wife has nothing to do with it; I am entirely responsible for the making of the counterfeit coins and the moulds; I made the moulds last week; I have been doing this for eight months." (This prisoner is mother to Sims's wife.)</p>

On the way to the station he said, "I must have been drunk at the time. This is what the drink brings you to." He was taken before the court and after he was remanded he said to me, "Do you think if I apologue to Mr. Levy he will stop the case; I am willing to be bound over and never do it again."</p>
