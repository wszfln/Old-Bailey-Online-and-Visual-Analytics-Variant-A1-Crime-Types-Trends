               <p>Q. On the 5th of January were you at your master's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was with you? - A. I was standing at the door with the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was it? - A.About half past nine at night; I was standing with my back against the waistcoat and the board where the shutters are put up; while the watchman and I were talking, a woman passed by the door several times, but I did not notice her at all; she came by again, and the watchman and I were talking about what fare he had met with in Harley-street; that he had had a dollop of turkey; my master's apprentice was standing at the door at the same time; his name is Lawrence Mawbey; the woman came by again, and said something to the boy, but what the words were, I did not hear; I then went into the road to make water; before I shut up the shop, and while I was there, I saw two persons go into the shop, whom I did not then know; one was Capt. Piers, and the other was the woman that I had seen pass the door before.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the two prisoners? - A. I know that gentleman, but the lady I do not know; that is the gentleman that went in with the lady; when I went into the shop, he was knocking with a stick against the boards.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was in the shop? - A.Nobody, till the boy came out of the yard, and met them; the boy had gone back into the yard; as Capt. Piers met him in the shop he collared him; I came up, and asked what was the matter; he intimated that the lady had been infulted, but I don't remember the words he used; the turned about, looked at me, and said to Capt. Piers, that is the man that insulted me, pointing to me; upon which he laid hold of me by the collar, and said he would charge the watch with me; he took me from the shop to the door, he pulled me by the collar, and then a man of the name of Hales came up, and said, William, you charge the watch with him; I said, what for, there is no insult at all given; at that instant he insisted upon the watch being charged with me, and then I charged the watch with him; the watchman came up, and put his arm round my shoulder, and got me and Capt. Piers both hold together.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that watchman's name? - A. Buckley, I think; and while we were in custody of the watchman, Capt, Piers withdrew back from the watchman, got out of the watchman's hands, and when he had got away, I said, it is a sad thing I am charged wrongfully, and tried to get away from the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did Capt. Piers go? - A. I cannot tell; he drew himself back from the watchman, and upon that instant he came up again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been absent? - A. Not half a moment; he withdrew himself behind me; he came up, and at that instant I was shot; I did not see him, nor I did not know I was shot; I do not know who shot me.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts were you shot? - A.Under the right ear; at that instant the watchman let me go, and I was taken to a surgeon's.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure that you have told all that passed, as far as you are concerned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to the lady whatever? A.Not a word, if I was to die this moment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.What was the name of the watchman you were conversing with at the time the lady was passing backwards and forwards? - A.His name is Corbett.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to represent that the Captain shot you as from behind? - A.From behind; I did not see him shoot me.</p>
               <p>Q.You never saw him, or spoke to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor attempted to lay hold of him? - A. No, I never attempted to lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q.There are some very respectable witnesses here, whom I shall examine upon that head; now do you mean to persist in it? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not see him at the time, did not attempt to lay hold of him, nor did not speak to him? - A.Not at that time, not after I had charged the watch with him.</p>
               <p>Q.Then of course you did not attempt to strike at any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200004"/>Q. That you are sure of? - A. I am sensible of it.</p>

               <p>Q.Was a person of the name of Hales there at that time? - A. I did not see him at the time; the watchman said, what am I to take charge of this man for? Captain Piers immediately said, for insulting this lady; I then saw the watchman take hold of both of them, and I saw no more till I heard the report of the pistol, I saw the flash, but did not see what passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fmowlys. Q.You made no particular remark about the lady at all? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q.What are you? - A. I belong to the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this transaction? A. On the 5th of January, about half past nine in the evening, I was passing by; within about forty yards from the corner of Paddington-street, I heard some people hooting, and saw the lady passing; when I came to the corner of Paddington-street, I observed Mr. Sharp's man and boy standing at the door; they were hooting a lady who was passing by; when she had got about twenty yards down High-street, she returned, and went into Paddington-street, and then they began hooting at her again, and called after her, rag, tag, and bob-tail, those were the expressions they made use of; when she got into Paddington-street, she went to the fishmonger's, and then a gentleman came out of the fishmonger's with her; at the time the gentleman came out of the shop with her, I observed the man go across High-street, and the boy seemed to go back, as if it was to the yard; the person who came out of the fishmonger's-shop went into the butcher's-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Capt. Piers that person? - A. Yes; he asked who it was that insulted the lady under his protection; there was nobody in the shop at the time he went in; Mrs. Sharp came out from the parlour; he knocked with a stick on the floor, and Mrs. Sharp came out.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were you standing at that time? - A. I was standing just at the door; Mrs. Sharp said, she could not tell who it was that insulted her, and then the boy came in from the yard.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she day no more than that? - A. I did not hear her say any more; when the boy came into the shop, Miss Johnstone said, that is the person who insulted me; when Capt. Piers immediately caught him by the coat, began to shake him, and asked him how he dared insult any body in the street.</p>
               <p>Q.What part of the coat did he take him by? - A.By the lappel; at the time he was shaking him, Cobb returned from the street, caught Mr. Piers by the arm, and asked him what he was doing; called him a stupid fool, and said, if he did not go out of the shop, he would turn him out.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Mrs. Sharp there at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the boy? - A. Yes; he immediately turned round, and desired him to take his arm off; he immediately returned, and went into the street from the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not touch Cobb? - A. I did not see him touch Cobb; when he got into the street, he called the watch; when the watchman came up, he desired him to take into his charge Mr. Cobb; immediately Mr. Cobb gave charge for charge, and they both went together; at that time Mr. Piers turned round, and began to speak to the watchman.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw him speak to the watchman? - A. I imagined him speaking to the watchman; I did not hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you as near to him as when you heard what passed between him and Mrs. Sharp? - A. No; when he appeared to speak to the watchman, Cobb jumped down the steps of the door, and began to swear very much indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time there were a great number of people there? - A.There might be about half a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q.Then all those half dozen heard and saw what passed as well as you? - A.They might for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they in the same situation that you were? - A. It they chose, I should think they might; he jumped down the steps, began to swear very much, and said, let me at him, I will give him his gruel; and it appeared to me as if several people attempted to stop Cobb; there appeared to be a bustle, as if they wished to stop-him from getting to Capt. Piers.</p>
               <p>Q.What did they do? - A.One before me laid hold of him, but he broke from him, and I laid hold of him myself, but he got from me; then he went towards Capt. Piers, and made two or three blows at him; at the time that he aimed at him, Miss Johnstone happened to step between Captain Piers and Cobb; at that moment I wished to get away; I turned my head round, and saw Cobb making another attempt to strike at him; I heard the report of a pistol, and saw that Cobb was shot in the face.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you happen to know either of the prisoners before? - A. No; I have often seen Cobb before, and I have seen Cobb sneer at me frequently as I have gone past.</p>
               <p>Q.You were offended at him? - A. I thought it was very unmannerly.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever make any complaint to the master or mistress? - A. No, I thought it the best way to take no notice of it.</p>

               <p>Q.Was there any thing in the dress or manner of Miss Johnstone to provoke the derision of any person? - A. No; I thought her dress was very becoming.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true or false that the had the least appearance of being disguised in liquor? - A. No, I did not imagine any thing of the kind; I thought her quite the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the decent in her dress and appearance? - A.She was.</p>
               <p>Q.You yourself saw several blows aimed by Cobb at Capt. Piers, before the pistol was fired? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the manner of Cobb violent at the time? - A.He appeared to be very much so, he swore very much.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you attended before the Magistrate, without being sent for by any body, to tell the truth of the transaction? - A.No, Miss Johnstone called upon me to request that I would.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Where do you live? - A.At Mr. Lowe's, the corner of Great Marybone-street, a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any business which took you on the evening this happened into this neighbourhood? - A. Yes; I was going of an errand for my master to the fishmonger's that joins Mr. Sharp's shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us what you observed? - A.Before I came to Mr. Sharp's, I saw Miss Johnstone walking; the turned back, and went past Mr. Sharp's; I passed her, and heard a boy hooting after her, the same as if they were driving a bullock or a sheep; upon looking round, I observed it was the butcher's boy.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know him before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when you first saw him? - A.Standing upon the steps of Mr. Sharp's shopdoor; I went on to the fishmonger's, and Mr. Piers was there cheapening a lobster, which was not boiled; the lady came in, and said, I with you would step out, for here are some boys that have very much insulted me; then the gentleman laid hold of her arm, and went to Mr. Sharp's.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that all the said to him? - A. Yes, that was all I heard; I saw the gentleman go into the shop, and knock hard with a stick; Mrs. Sharp came out, and asked what was the matter; he said, the boy had insulted a lady; Mrs. Sharp said, the boy had not, for he had just come out of the yard; then the person that was shot said, no, she had not been insulted there.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure it was Cobb said so? - A. Yes. I am sure it was him; then there was a quarrel between Mr. Piers and Cobb; I saw Mr. Piers come down the steps of the butcher's door, and he called the watch three or four times; the watchman came, and Mr. Piers gave charge of Cobb.</p>
               <p>Q.Did that draw any people round? - A. There was a vast concourse of people; upon that somebody called, give charge for charge, and there was charge for charge given.</p>
               <p>Q.After Cobb had given charge of Capt. Piers, what followed then? - A.Mr. Piers seemed to decline it, and was going up Paddington-street; Cobb finding that, seemed very much enraged; he broke away from the watchman, and tried to strike at him.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us how he tried to strike at him? - A. Several people had hold of him, and he broke away from them, and tried to strike at him.</p>
               <p>Q.Shew us in what manner he did it? - A.He squared at him with his fist. - (Describing it.)</p>
               <p>Q.What happened upon that? - A.Upon that I saw Miss Johnstone get between them, and try to shove Cobb away, to keep him from striking.</p>
               <p>Q.What happened upon that? - A. A vast concourse of people assembled; I had a large dish under my arm, and I got out of the mob, and in two or three seconds after that I heard the report.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing either in the dress, or conduct, or manner of Miss Johnstone, to induce these people to hoot after her? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to be a woman disguised by intoxication? - A.Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing indecent in her dress or manner? - A.Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you acquainted with either of the prisoners? - A.No, I was a stranger to them.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to be subpoenaed? - A. After<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200010"/>I had seen what I did, I went home, and told it to my master.</p>
               <p>Q.In consequence of which, I believe he gave information? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q.You say, you remember his coming out of the fishmonger's shop, and going into the butcher's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Relate what passed at that time? - A. Mrs. Sharp came out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q.How is the parlour situated with respect to the shop? - A.The parlour is on the left-hand.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you see the parlour at all? - A. No, but I should suppose, by the door, it was the parlour; there are some windows in the shop, which I took to be the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q.Who spoke first? - A.Captain Piers said, some boys had very much insulted the lady.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were you when he said that? - A. I was by the door.</p>
               <p>Q.What answer was made to that? - A. She said, her boy was just come out of the yard, and the man came up, and said, nobody had been infulted there.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the boy in the shop when Cobb came in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was in the shop when Mrs. Sharp came in? - A.Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Piers did not take hold of the boy first? - A.Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, whether he took hold of the boy or not? - A. I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q.Must you have seen him, if he had? - A. Yes, I think I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Miss Johnstone accusing the boy of having insulted her? - A. Yes, the said, that was the boy that had infulted her. (Pointing to the apprentice.)</p>
               <p>Q.And then Captain Piers did not lay hold of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Cobb in the shop at that time? - A. He came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Cobb was there, when the said, that was the boy that infulted her? - A. He came in at that time.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she not, after having said the boy infulted her, tell Captain Piers to let go the boy, for that it was Cobb that had infulted her; I heard her say, that they had both infulted her.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he take both into custody afterwards? - A. No, he gave charge of Cobb, and the boy said, he would go to the watch-house likewise, but charge was not given of him.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they all go to the door together? - A. Yes, they all came out to the door together.</p>
               <p>Q.You said Captain Piers went out to the door and called watch, did he not drag Cobb with him by the collar? - A.No, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you mean to say, you did not see him touch Cobb at all? - A. No, I did not see him touch either of them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see the watchman take hold of Captain Piers? - A. Yes, there were two or three watchmen got hold of him, after the pistol was fired.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any watchman take hold of Captain Piers, before the siring of the pistol? - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q.You saw all that passed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, perhaps, you will swear he was not taken hold of by the watchman? - A.Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q.And you are as sure of that as you are of any thing else you have told us? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then Captain Piers, being in custody, could not get out of custody, by shifting his arm? - A. No, he was walking away.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, though he was charged, the watchman went away without offering to detain him? - A. Yes, he was going up Paddington-street.</p>

               <p>Q.And the watchman did not attempt to detain him, do you mean that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.The watchman never touched him at all? - A.Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q.And you saw all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a shoemaker, of the name of Hall, being there? - A. No, I did not know any one in the place.</p>
               <p>Q.You saw Cobb running after the prisoner to attempt to strike at him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that repeatedly? - A. He did it two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he strike him at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the watchmen near him at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw all the people there that have been examined this morning? - A. Not to take any notice of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are perfectly sure, that before the report of the pistol, this man had made two or three attempts to strike at Mr. Piers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.When you found Mr. Piers and the lady attempt to get away, was that before you heard the report of the pistol, or after? - A. It was before the report of the pistol.</p>

Yes; I came up to Mr. Sharp's door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200011"/>just as the gentleman came down the steps with the lady, and he was calling for the watch; the watchman took Cobb into custody, and then some person persuaded Cobb to charge the prisoner; after that, Mr. Piers took hold of the lady, and seemed to be going away down Paddington-street; Cobb extricated himself frem the watchman, and followed him, he had put himself in a posture, as I suppose, to strike him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him attempt to strike? - A. I did not, I was not near enough.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, no mischief had been done? - A. No, some bad language had passed between both parties; after that, I saw Miss Johnstone drive Cobb back again, and in a few seconds after that, I heard the report of the pistol, but I did not see it fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure, that when Cobb broke away, the prisoners were apparently going away? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see either of the prisoners before? - A.Never.</p>

               <p>Q. And the watchman took hold of both? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them first got out of the watchman's hands? - A. Captain Piers.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure the watchman had hold of him? - A. So far as to clap his hands upon him.</p>

               <p>Q.Where were you? - A. I was standing at the post opposite the door.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you see Cobb quite free from the watchman? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he run after Captain Piers? - A. Yes, he made all the haste he could.</p>
               <p>Q.How far might he have got? - A.Nearly to the extremity of Mr. Sharp's premises.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see him strike Mr. Piers? - A. No, I only saw him put himself in an attitude to strike.</p>
               <p>Q. When Miss Johnstone drove him back, did he turn towards Mr. Piers? - A. He immediately received the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he received the wound, had not the watchman hold of Cobb? - A. I cannot say, there were a number of people between me and Captain Piers, I did not see him fire the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q.Then, for any thing you know, they might have hold of him? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Gentlemen of the Jury, you have been informed by the Officer of the Court what is the nature of the offence which upon the inquisition you are now charged to try, and you find, that that inquisition imputes to the gentleman at the Bar the charge of killing and slaying with a pistol a gentleman of the name of Montgomery. Gentlemen, in the course of the few observations, accompanying the facts of this case, which I shall have the honour to address to you upon the present occasion, I shall carefully abstain from making any observations that may be thought by any body to create any prejudice against the gentleman at the bar. Gentlemen, I feel that all cases when they come into a Court of Justice to be tried, are to be tried by a Jury of the country upon the evidence that is given before them, and upon that evidence only. Gentlemen, I feel in this case that which we all in our turn often feel upon others, that much prejudice has been excited by the daily public prints with respect to the case which is now brought before you for enquiry. You can but feel with me the impropriety of making observations upon a case which is afterwards to be enquired of by a Jury of the country, both as they may tend on the part of the prosecution to detail evidence that shall be given against the party accused, and as they may tend, perhaps, more materially for the interest of the prisoner, to prejudice the minds of those who are to pass upon him in judgment afterwards. Gentlemen, in the course of this Session, I have the good fortune to state, that I am sure no such observations, through the medium of public prints, or in any other way that may have come to your knowledge, can possibly work upon your minds in the consideration of this case, because I have seen, in the course of this Sessions, that you will attend to the oath you have taken, and decide according to the circumstances as they are stated before you in evidence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the charge before you upon this inqui<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200012"/>sition is that of Manslaughter only, and you full well know (which must give every body satisfaction) that that charge does not affect the life of the prisoner at the bar; but it is a charge of a very great, of a very important nature, as it respects the interests of society, and the peace of the public; and in proportion as the charge is of importance, in proportion as it creates anxiety in those who hear, and those who are to judge of it, so in proportion does it deserve, and I am sure it will have, your serious attention.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am not aware, and if I was aware of any law that could be stated upon the subject, I should not feel it necessary, in a Court constituted as this is, to venture any ideas of the law upon the subject, as it respects manslaughter, because in such a Court you will have it better stated to you. I might probably make some mistake, which might affect the prisoner in a way in which it ought not; but I am not aware of any question of law. The only question is, whether the gentleman who is charged to have been killed, lost his life by the hands of the prisoner at the bar, in a rencontre which took place between them at Primrose-hill; and if you are of opinion he was the cause of the death of that gentleman by a pistol, having previously agreed to go out to determine a dispute, there can be no question in any body's mind with respect to the law upon the subject, but that it is properly described upon this inquisition to be Manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the prisoner at the bar, Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person65">Macnamara</persName>
            , is a gentleman very respectably connected; a gentleman who is highly praised for his magnanimity, and every thing that a gentleman in any situation could desire to have spoken of him. The deceased was also a gentleman of a character equally deserving attention from every body with whom he was connected, deserving the affection and regard of every body equally with the gentleman at the bar.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the facts of this case lie in a very narrow compass, and I am the only feeble instrument, on the part of the family of the deceased, in conveying to you the facts of the evidence which I shall have the honour of laying before you, neither wishing nor being instructed to say any thing that should work a prejudice against the gentleman at the bar, at the same time taking care to discharge my duty to the public, by laying before you the whole of the evidence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Colonel Montgomery was in Hyde. Park, riding up and down between the bridge and the bar, where the horsemen come in. There were two large Newsoundland dogs, one belonging to Colonel Montgomery, the other belonging to the prisoner at the bar. The dogs attacked each other; they fought a battle. Col. Montgomery, seeing his dog had the worst of it, got off his horse, and asked "whose dog it was?" The prisoner, Capt. Macnamara, said, "it was his." Col. Montgomery said, "if you do not call your dog off, I shall knock him down." The defendant said, "have you the arrogance to say you will knock my dog down? How is it possible to prevent the fighting of dogs in an open field?" This word Arrogance, I understand, was made use of several times by the defendant. The defendant said, "he was a Captain (as was true, and a most respectable one) in the Royal Navy." After this nothing more passed that I am aware of, excepting that they pursued their different courses, and went towards Piccadilly; when they arrived in Piccadilly, some circumstances transpired, which I shall not state, because it is not evidence; but in consequence of that, I believe you will find that an appointment was made to meet within two hours at Primrose-hill. The persons who met at Primrose-hill you will find beyond all question to be Colonel Montgomery, the unfortunate gentleman at the bar, a Major Keir, or some such name, a Capt. Barry, and a gentleman very respectable in his line, Mr. Heaviside. When they are there, the ground is taken, a duel takes place, pistols are presented both by Col. Montgomery, who is dead, and the prisoner at the bar. Col. Montgomery fell. The prisoner received a desperate wound, under which he now labours. Col. Montgomery very speedily after died, and I shall be able to prove, beyond all doubt, that he died in consequence of the wound he received from the pistol; I shall be able to prove it by a gentleman who happened to be upon the spot, who knew nothing of the parties, who saw the pistols fired, and who stood about fifty yards off; he will be able to identify the persons of both the Gentlemen; he will prove to you that both of them were wounded in consequence of the firing; that Col. Montgomery was taken off the field, and died very soon after, and that Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person66">Macnamara</persName>
             was immediately taken.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, from a fear of stating more than I ought to do, or with more strength of observation than the circumstances seem to call for, I have abstained from any comment, leaving it to you to draw your conclusions from the evidence, when you shall have heard it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I believe I have now performed my duty in stating the outline of the case before you. Gentlemen, the prosecutor (and God forbid he should) entertains no with, he feels no anxiety at all about the fate of this trial; he only wishes, through me, to lay this case before you, that you may give that verdict which justice and the peace of society require you to give; and if, through the medium of this trial, such circumstances again taking place should be prevented, it will be, perhaps, one of the most important and one of the most advantageous trials that ever came before a Jury of the country, because it will have the effect of preventing those fatal consequences to which I have been calling your attention.</p>
               <p>Evidence for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you in Hyde-park on Wednesday the 6th of April? - A. Yes, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you on horseback? - A. Yes, in company with my brother and the deceased, Colonel Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any dogs with you? - A. There was a dog following Col. Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q. A dog of what nature? - A. A Newfoundland dog, and there was another Newfoundland dog belonging to Capt. Macnamara.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that gentleman at that time? - A. No; there were several gentlemen with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200013"/>Q.Whereabouts was it? - A.Between the bridge and the barrier.</p>
               <p>Q.Did any thing happen between the dogs? - A.They began fighting, they were both Newfoundland dogs. I observed Col. Montgomery turn round, and jump from his horse, in order to separate the dogs; they did separate. I heard Col. Montgomery call out, "whose dog is this?" Capt. Macnamara answered, "that is my dog." Col. Montgomery said, "if you don't call your dog off, I shall knock him down." I do not exactly use his words. Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person68">Macnamara</persName>
             said,"Have you the arrogance to say, Sir, that you will knock my dog down?" Col. Montgomery said, "I certainly shall knock the dog down if it falls upon mine again." About this time Lord Burghersh joined Col. Montgomery, my brother, and myself; a conversation ensued, and I think I heard the word Arrogance again from Captain Macnamara. Lord Burghersh joined us again about that time, and we proceeded on to Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q.All of you? - A. All of us; I heard Col. Montgomery say, "Col. Montgomery," and I heard Capt. Macnamara say, "Captain Macnamara, of the Royal Navy." Col. Montgomery expressed a disinclination to quarrel; he said,"Sir, it is not my intention to quarrel with you, Capt. Macnamara; but if your dog falls upon mine, I shall knock him down," or something of that sort. We had some conversation in Piccadilly; I took leave of Col. Montgomery at the top of St. James's-street, with an intention of going home; I turned round, and saw Capt. Macnamara's party turning back from St. James's church; they had gone forward; I saw them turning back to go to St. James's-street; I had at that time got a little way up Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, where was Col. Montgomery going? - A. I had taken leave of him, and he went down St. James's-street with my brother and Lord Burghersh. I then returned to my friends, and when I got into Jermyn-street, I saw Col. Montgomery going towards St. James's church; I rode after him, and then I saw the prisoner and Colonel Montgomery, and other persons; they were about thirty yards separate, in Jermyn-street, and then some gentleman rode up to Col. Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q.Whatever was then said, I suppose it was impossible for Capt. Macnamara to hear it? - A. Yes; a gentleman rode up by my side from Capt. Macnamara to Col. Montgomery, whom I have since understood was Capt. Barry.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the same person who went from Capt. Macnamara to Col. Montgomery return to Capt. Macnamara again? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. You saw the dogs begin to fight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They met each other of their own accord? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.There was no reason for supposing the dogs were set on by either of their owners? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Col. Montgomery said, whose dog is this? - A. To the best of my recollection he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Capt. Macnamara said, he is mine? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Capt. Macnamara was dressed as a gentleman, and had the appearance of a gentleman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was no reason to suppose that that gentleman, who was a stranger, had been at all concerned in setting his dog on? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which Col. Montgomery said, "if you do not call your dog off, I will knock him down? - A. Yes, to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as let us know in what way he said that - did he pull off his hat, and say, Sir, be so good as call your dog off? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Instead of that, he said, if your do not call your dog off, I will knock him down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not say it in a very gentle manner? - A.No, I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Not in a very conciliating manner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, Capt. Macnamara said, "have you the arrogance to say you will knock my dog down?" - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which Col. Montgomery again said, he would knock the dog down if he attacked his dog again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I will remind you of only one expression more- Did he not say to Capt. Macnamara, if he was offended with those expressions, he knew where to find him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this subsequent to telling him he was a Captain in the Royal Navy? - A. I cannot say whether it was before or after.</p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Were you in Hyde-park on the 6th of April, in the afternoon? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q.With your brother and Col. Montgomery? - A. Col. Montgomery joined us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Col. Montgomery before? - A. I knew his person, but I did not know him to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember coming to the barrier in Rotten-row? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Col. Montgomery having a Newfoundland dog with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any other person coming up who had also a Newfoundland dog? - A. That was before we came to the barrier; the first I heard was seeing the dogs fighting, and Col. Montgomery seeing his dog undermost, turned round and jumped off his horse to separate the dogs.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he was endeavouring to separate the dogs, did you see the other gentlemen? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200014"/>While he was separating the dogs, the other gentlemen rode up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the other gentlemen? - A.Capt. Macnamara was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes; when Col. Montgomery jumped off his horse, he made this observation upon going up to the dogs, I will knock that dog down if he commits a violence upon my dog, or words to that effect; Capt. Macnamara then rode up, and said, if you knock my dog down, Sir, you must knock me down afterwards; Col. Montgomery made some observation, which I do not exactly recollect.</p>
               <p>Q.Try to recollect? - A. He said to Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person70">Macnamara</persName>
            , this public place is not a proper place for the adjustment of the dispute; my name is Col. Montgomery, you may know where to find me. Capt. Macnamara then said, my name is Capt. Macnamara, of the Royal Navy. Colonel Montgomery then observed, that Capt. Macnamara could not suppose he intended any offence, either by desiring him to call off his dog, or by saying he would knock the dog down. Captain Macnamara then observed, very nearly in words to this effect, that he did not feel himself offended by what had passed; but if Col. Montgomery did say any thing that was intended to offend him, he would have taken it up with the greatest eagerness, or words very much to that effect, words that tended exactly to that effect; I cannot recollect the exact words, because a number of persons came up, and asked me what had happened, which took off my attention.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect any thing else that passed? A. I recollect Capt. Macnamara used the word Arrogance several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing else? - A. I recollect nothing else; they separated; the parties went along Piccadilly; Col. Montgomery and his party, consisting, I think, of three persons; they were pretty nearly together till they got into Piccadilly; they separated in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into Piccadilly with them? - A. I went into Piccadilly with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the parties divide? - A.Almost immediately after they got through the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them together at any time afterwards? - A. We went on, Capt. Macnamara and his friends keeping about fifty yards before us; Capt. Macnamara was first; we went in this way till we got to St. James's-street, at pretty nearly the same distance; when we got into St. James's-street, my brother left us; Lord Burghersh and myself went into Jermyn-street; when we got down Jermyn-street, as far as the church, my brother rode up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not state any thing that passed in the absence of Capt. Macnamara; did you see any thing of Capt. Macnamara afterwards? - A.My brother rode up, and another person, whom I have understood since to have been Capt. Barry; it was one of the persons who rode with him up Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q.You are quite sure he was one of those persons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After some conversation, did the same gentleman return to Capt. Macnamara? - A. He did return to Capt. Macnamara, who was about fifteen yards behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I believe you know nothing more about it? - A. I know nothing more about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You told us very truly persons asked you questions, which took off your attention; your recollection does not appear to be very accurate; do you recollect his desiring Capt. Macnamara to call his dog off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the terms in which a gentleman, having the appearance of a gentleman, in the Park, was desired to call off his dog? - A.He said in a hurry, whose dog is it, not appearing to me to know who the dog belonged to.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon asking what dog it was, Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person71">Macnamara</persName>
             said, it was his dog? - A. I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember this expression, "that must depend upon circumstances, if you knock my dog down, you must knock me down?" - A. No; I think that must have been at the time Mr. Duff rode up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, I am Col. Montgomery, you may know where to find me? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Lord BURGHERSH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Did you join Col. Montgomery and a Mr. Sloane in the Park on Wednesday the 6th of April? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at any dispute that happened between any Newsoundland dogs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You came up afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you come up? - A.When Col. Montgomery, Capt. Macnamara, and other persons were about twenty yards from the upper bar, I was coming from St. James's-park, and met them; the first thing I heard was, Colonel Montgomery said, "very well, Sir, I shall knock your dog down if he attacks mine;" Capt. Macnamara's answer was, "but your desiring me to call off my dog was arrogant language, not language fit to be used by a gentleman, or to a gentleman," I don't recollect which;" Col. Montgomery said, "if you feel yourself injured, you know where to apply;" after that Colonel Montgomery said, "do you feel yourself injured;" Capt. Macnamara, said, "no, Sir, not by any thing which has yet happened; but if you say any thing that shall affront me, I will take it up as soon as any man in England;" Col. Montgomery said, "No, it is not my intention to quarrel with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200015"/>you, but I shall adhere to what I originally said, if your dog attacks mine, I shall knock him down." They then separated, and were passing through the Park-gate. Capt. Macnamara said, that he would as soon fight him as any other person; that he would revenge an insult, and would as soon fight with Col. Montgomery as any other person. Capt. Macnamara was at some distance at that time; he was shaking a stick which he had in his hand, but I did not conceive it was any thing more than an involuntary thing, I think it was the act of the moment from the agitation he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Not intended to insult? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go on with the parties? - A. Yes; they had been separated about twenty yards, and we rode on to St. James's-street, having been at a variable distance from twenty to thirty yards; there was some conversation whether the thing was over or not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not in the hearing of Captain Macnamara? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your Lordship saw no more of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q.Did your Lordship hear Capt. Macnamara ask whose dog it was? - A.No, I was not there at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. At that time did you observe any dogs? - A. Two dogs began fighting immediately behind my horse; Col. Montgomery, whom I had never seen before, turned back, passed me, got off his horse, and standing over the dog said, I will knock the dog down; he did not strike either of the dogs, they separated themselves. Captain Macnamara then rode up, and said to Col. Montgomery, if you do knock the dog down, you must take the consequences, or knock me down too; Colonel Montgomery then said, why do not you call your dog off; Capt. Macnamara then replied, no, Sir, I do not chuse to call my dog off, and I will not be dictated to by you or any man.</p>
               <p>Q.At this time then, Colonel Montgomery got upon his horse again? - A. He got upon his horse immediately, and then said, well, Sir, if your dog fights mine, I repeat to you, I will knock him down, and you shall be very welcome to know where to find me; as a gentleman you should have called your dog off. Capt. Macnamara then said, no, Sir, I did not chuse to call my dog off, I chose to let him fight; and I tell you again, I will not be dictated to by you or any man; I ought to know now, Sir, where to find you for what you have already said. At this time different gentlemen closed in upon them, that I had not an opportunity of hearing what further passed.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you known Colonel Montgomery before? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Were the Mr. Sloanes there? - A. I don't know.</p>

             say,"nothing that has been said has given me offence, but if any thing is said purposely to offend me, I would take it up?" - A. No, I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not examined before the Coroner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.This is the first time your memory has been brought to it, the other gentlemen were examined the next day? - A. I was examined before Sir Richard Ford.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you desired to go with a chaise to Dover-street, on Wednesday afternoon, the 6th of April? - A. In the first place, I was ordered to go to St. James's-street, which I did, Captain Barry came there in a hackney-coach, and ordered me to follow him; I followed him from there to Bennet-street, St. James's; as soon as I turned the corner, he stopped; I stopped just beyond the hackney-coach, he pulled a case out of the hackneycoach, and put it into my chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in that case? - A. I don't know; he then told me to drive down Dover-street, as fast as I could drive, I did so; he ordered me to drive to No. 8, I stopped there, and delivered the case out to Captain Barry, and he took it into the house.</p>
               <p>Q.How long after did Captain Barry come out of the house again? - A.About four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come out alone? - A.He came out alone; and then afterwards he brought the case out in his hand.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200016"/>Q.That gentleman and Captain Barry got into the chaise? - A. Yes, they ordered me to drive to Chalk-farm, I told them I did not know where that was.</p>
               <p>Q.However, you found out where it was, and drove there? - A. Yes; there was a gentleman with one arm stopped us before we got there, and some conversation took place, but what it was, I do not know; a short time after, Captain Barry got out of the chaise, and walked up the field with the gentleman with one arm; in a short time afterwards, Mr. Heaviside and the gentleman got out of the chaise, and walked into the field with the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see anybody else? - A.Directly after, came up a hackney-coach, the gentleman with one arm went to the hackney-coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see anybody in the hackney-coach? I did not, nor did not then see anybody get out of it; the gentleman asked the coachman where the company were in the coach, and then a gentleman got out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that gentleman was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up Primrose-hill yourself? - A. I did not; I went into a public-house and had a pint of beer to drink.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you see anybody return? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the persons return that you had taken to Chalk-farm? - A. There was one gentleman returned first, and the other was brought afterwards with assistance; the person I helped to put on the bed, was Colonel Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a space was there, from the time you all went, and the time you helped to put this person upon the bed? - A. It might be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the gentleman that you had taken in your chaise again that day? - A. I did so, I saw him come up to the chaise, and instead of getting into my chaise, he got into the Three-King's chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular about his person at the time he got into the chaise? - A. They wanted him to have assistance in the chaise, and he wanted to get into the chaise himself, and he did; he was the second that went in, and Mr. Heaviside was the third.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he appear to be wounded too? - A. Yes; I was with Colonel Montgomery, and a gentleman said to Mr. Heaviside, that Macnamara was wounded; he ordered another gentleman to clap his hand on the lint for him to put on the wound, and then he went to Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person77">Macnamara</persName>
            , and put a bit of lint on him.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, when both these gentlemen had this lint, where were the pistols, did you see them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both fall? - A. No, only Colonel Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did you stay in the field? - A. I cannot say; I dare say it was twenty minutes; I stopped there while Colonel Montgomery was led by two, while I was ordered to fetch the chaise up, which I did, and I lifted Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person78">Macnamara</persName>
             into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200017"/>the chaise, and brought him down to Chalk-farm, and then a hackney-coach was sent up for Colonel Montgomery.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you parted with Colonel Montgomery, had he died? - A. He was not dead; I helped to carry him up stairs afterwards, he was not dead then.</p>

               <p>Q. What o'clock was it? - A. I think, about half-past six; I went up and stood upon the hill, at about fifty yards distance from them, I saw them conversing together.</p>

            , and I think Mr. Heaviside, then I saw them preparing pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Who preparing pistols? - A. I don't positively know; one pistol was discharged, as it struck me, to ascertain whether it was in good condition.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom, do you recollect? - A. I don't know, the parties then separated and fired.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Heaviside, of course, administered relief? - A. He dressed the wound, and then went to Captain Macnamara.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he appear to be? - A. He was groaning, and his eyes fixed.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the appearance of a dying man? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it the person you saw in the park, that died? - A. Yes, I saw the corpse afterwards, at Chalk-farm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My Lord, that is the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, on being asked if he had any thing to say in his defence, rose up, and begged permission to read to the Gentlemen of the Jury, and the Court, a written defence, which he had prepared. This he was allowed to do, and to keep his seat, on account of his being still very weak, from his wound. It was as follows:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>I appear before you, with the consolation that my character has already been delivered, by the verdict of a Grand Jury, from the shocking Imputation of murder; and that although the evidence against me was laid before them, without any explanation or evidence of the sensations which brought me into my present unhappy situation, they made their own impression; and no charge of criminal homicide was found against me. I was delivered at once from the whole effect of the indictment. I therefore now stand before you, upon the inquisition only, taken before the Coronor, upon the view of the body, under circumstances extremely affecting to the mind of those who were to deliberate on the transaction, and without the opportunity; which the benignity of the law affords me at this moment, of repelling that inference of even sudden resentment against the deceased, which is the foundation of this inquest of manslaughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200018"/>The origin of the difference, as you see it in the evidence, was insignisicant: - The heat of two persons, each desending an animal under his protection; was natural, and could not have led to any serious consequences. It was not the deceased's defending his own dog, or his threatening to destroy mine, that led to the fatal catastrophe: It was the defiance alone, which most unhappily accompanied what was said; words receive their interpretation from the avowed intention of the speaker. The offence was forced upon me by the declaration, that he invited me to be offended, and challenged me to vindicate the offence by calling upon him for satisfaction."If you are offended with what is past, you know where to find me." These words, unfortunately repeated and reiterated, have over and over again been considered by Criminal Courts of Justice as sufficient to support an indictment for a challenge. These Judgments of Courts are founded upon the universal understandings and feelings of mankind, and common candour must admit that an Officer, however desirous to avoid a quarrel, cannot refuse to understand what even the grave Judges of the Law must interpret as a provocation and a desiance. I declare, therefore, most solemnly, that I went into the field from no resentment against the deceased, nothing, indeed, but infanity could have led me to expose my own life to such imminent peril, under the impulse of passion, from so inadequate a cause as the evidence before you exhibits, when separated from the desiance which was the fatal source of mischief, and I could well have overlooked that too, if the world, in its present state, could have overlooked it also. I went into the field, therefore, with no determination or desire to take the life of my opponent, or to expose my own. I went there in hopes of receiving some soothing satisfaction, for what would otherwise have exposed me, in the general feelings and opinions of the world. The deceased was a man of popular manners, as I have heard, and with a very general acquaintance. I, on the other hand, was in a manner, a stranger in this great town, having been devoted, from my infancy, to the duties of my prosession in distant seas. If, under these circumstances, words which the deceased intended so offensive, and which he repeatedly invited to be resented, had been passed by and submitted to, they would have passed from mouth to mouth, have been even exaggerated at every repetition, and my honour must have been lost.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am a Captain of the British Navy. My character you can only hear from others; but to maintain any character, in that station, I must be respected. When called upon to lead others into honourable danger, I must not be supposed to be a man who had sought safety by submitting to what custom has taught others to consider as a disgrace. I am not presuming to urge any thing against the laws of God, or of this land. I know that, in the eye of religion and reason, obedience to the law, though against the general feelings of the world, is the first duty, and ought to be the rule of action: but, in putting a construction upon my motives, so as to ascertain the quality of my actions, you will make allowances for my situation. It is impossible to desine in terms, the proper feelings of a gentleman; but their existence have supported this happy country for many ages, and she might perish if they were lost, Gentlemen, I will detain you no longer: I will bring before you many honourable persons, who will speak what they know of me in my profession, and in private life, which will the better enable you to judge whether what I have offered in my defence may safely be received by you as truth. Gentlemen, I submit myself entirely to your judgments. I hope to obtain my liberty, through your verdict; and to employ it with honour in the defence of the liberties of my country.</p>
               <p>Evidence for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant HINDE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. You are an officer? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you continue to be present while Capt. Macnamara and Col. Montgomery were in the Park? - A. When they came out of the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near enough to hear all that passed to the time of their separating? - A. No; they went through the gate together, and I returned into the Park.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you near enough to hear what passed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you recollect it well? - A. I recollect some of the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q.Be so good as tell us how it began? - A. The dogs met and sought; Col. Montgomery got off his horse, and said, if that dog fights mine, I will knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Capt. Macnamara present at this time? - A.He was near enough to hear it; he was going the other way down the Park; I believe Col. Montgomery repeated, if that dog fights mine, I will knock him down; to which Capt. Macuamara replied, if you knock him down, you must knock me down first; they rode up the Park a little way together, and I believe they exchanged their addresses, but that I cannot speak positively to; I heard Col. Montgomery say to Capt. Macnamara, why do not you take your dog off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that as you would speak to a gentleman, whose dog was attacking your's, or did he say it in a rude manner? - A.He was evidently heated; Capt. Macnamara said, you are not to dictate to me, Sir, and then I left them; I heard Col. Montgomery say, it is very well, Sir, if you have any thing to say to me, you know where to find me.</p>
               <p>Lord HOOD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erskine.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has your Lordship known him? - A. I have known him eight or ten years; I had the good fortune to promote him in the year 1794.)</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask your Lordship, after having used the expression you had the good fortune<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200019"/>to promote him in the year 1794, whether he was an officer of merit? -</p>
               <p>Court. That is not the question; I will not have that question answered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Q.Will your Lordship tell us what has been his general demeanour; has he always conducted himself properly? - A. I never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a man of good temper? - A.He was a man of great moderation; he served under my command, when I had an opportunity of knowing him; it was on account of the high situation that he held in my opinion that I promoted him as an officer and a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Lord NELSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q.Be so good as inform the Court how long you have known Captain 
               <persName id="t18030420-2-person84">Macnamara</persName>
            ? - A. I have known Capt. Macnamara about nine years; he has been at various times under my command; during my long acquaintance with him, I have not only had the highest respect for him as an officer, but although I have always believed Capt. Macnamara a gentleman that would not take an affront from any man, yet, as I stand here before God and my country, I must add, that I never knew or heard that he ever gave an offence to man, woman, or child, during the nine years I have had the pleasure of knowing him.</p>
               <p>Lord HOTHAM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How long have you known Capt. Macnamara? - A.Ever since the year 1764.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the greatest part of his life? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.During all that time, what has been the Captain's character for good temper? - A. I had an opportunity of seeing a great deal of him; I always found him a gentleman in every respect, always behaved properly and civilly in company; he is a very good-tempered man.</p>
               <p>Lord MINTO sworn. - I have had the honour of knowing Capt. Macnamara ever since 1783, and from that time to the beginning of the year 1797, I had occasion to be very frequently on board the fleet; I had the honour of seeing him on board the ship he commanded; I have had occasion to see him at my own house several times.</p>
               <p>Q. What character does this gentleman bear as to temper and behaviour? - A. In private life, with the opportunity I had of knowing his manners, I always thought him a lively, chearful, good-humoured companion, and never heard that he had occasion to be in any disputation or quarrel in my life; I believe his disposition is exactly the reverse.</p>
               <p>Sir HYDE PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. How long have you known Captain Macnamara? - A.Ever since the year 1790.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as state to the Jury what his estimation has been, as far as it has come to your knowledge, from your observation, and the opinions of others, as to his temper and disposition? - A. I am more able to speak to that than any body; his temper was moderate, and far from being quarrelsome; I have frequently heard, that he was that sort of man who would not receive an insult from another, but I never heard of his being quarrelsome; nor do I know, among all the little things that happen on board ship, any quarrel on his part; his character is that of a very honours able and respectable man in every point of view.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you observed of his character for good nature and humanity? - A. I never saw him quarrel; I have been in habits of intimacy with him a long time; he is a good tempered man, I never saw in him a disposition to quarrel.</p>
               <p>General CHURCHILL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erskine. Q.How long have you known Captain Macnamara? - A.Two years; I knew him first in the West Indies; I was introduced to him by a friend, and I thought myself indebted to that friend for his introducing to my acquaintance a gentleman of such known good character. I failed, with him from Jamaica, and lived in his cabin; I considered him a man of the strictest honour, and a good-humoured, lively companion; I know from a particular circumstance that occurred during our acquaintance, that he is far from being a quarrelsome man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner also called Capt. George Martin, Mr. Phillips, Capt. Towley, Dr. Bain, Mr. Charles Wright, Capt. Liddiard, Capt. Waller, Capt. Graham Moore, and Capt. Fellows, who gave him a similar character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, James Macnamara, the prisoner at the bar, stands charged with the crime of manslaughter, in feloniously discharging a pistol loaded with ball, and giving a mortal wound to Robert Montgomery, of which he died. Your province, Gentlemen, will be very limited indeed on this occasion, because that fact has not only been proved by witnesses, but acknowledged by the prisoner himself in the defence he has made. The crime of manslaughter consists in slaying a man under sudden provocation. Fortunately for the prisoner in this case - very fortunately for the prisoner, we are not to examine the extent of that provocation. Though true it is there was a sudden quarrel between the parties, yet a very considerable time intervened between that quarrel and the time of fighting the duel; and if the inquisition had found the prisoner guilty of murder, then you would have had the most painful<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200020"/>task to enquire whether there was time for the passions to cool (for the law is a stranger to all those nice sentiments of honour) and if there was, it would have amounted to murder. Gentlemen, a great deal of evidence has been gone into; it is not necessary for me to state to you particularly what that evidence is; it is fresh in your memory; and it appears, that afterwards, in consequence of this sudden quarrel, they parted from each other; they afterwards met - how they met, and by what appointment they met, does not appear; but it does appear they met at Chalk-farm, which is a considerable distance from the place of quarrel (a considerable space of time having elapsed) and decided their quarrel in the manner you have heard; and, as it now appears in evidence, the deceased died in consequence of a shot discharged from a pistol by the prisoner. The prisoner has acknowledged the fact, which appears also upon the evidence, and, therefore, however high his character may stand upon the evidence he has called, that ought not to influence your verdict. The only question for you to try is, whether, in a quarrel under a sudden provocation like this, and as this must now be taken to be, the deceased did not fall in the manner I have stated, by the hand and act of the prisoner. That appears to me most clear, both upon the evidence given, and upon the prisoner's own acknowledgement. Consider of your verdict, Gentlemen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Your fowls used to fly away over the garden-wall? - A.No, they did not; a great many other people round the country had lost fowls also.</p>

               <p>GEORGE HOWARD sworn. - I am gardener to Mr. Freeman: On Saturday the 19th of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I put up the fowls in a hen-house in the yard; there was a padlock on the door, but it was not locked; there were eight hens and a cock. I heard the dog in the yard make a terrible noise between three and four o'clock in the morning; I sleep in a room adjoining the yard; I did not get up till about six o'clock; I went to the hen-house, and they were all gone; I saw them again in Islington watch-house on the Sunday evening; they were then dead; the cock had no feathers on his breast, and I cut all their wings, because they used to get over into the garden; I had the training of them; some of them were speckled; there was one white one; they had smooth feathers; I can swear they were my master's fowls; I did not see the prisoner till Monday morning, about ten o'clock; he was stopped by the watchman; I never saw him near the house that I know of.</p>

               <p>CHARLES DIXON sworn. - I am a patrol of the parish of Islington: On Sunday morning the 20th of March, about half past five o'clock, I was on duty; I saw the prisoner come across the fields with two bags hung across his shoulder; I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there; he said, he had nothing; I put my hand upon the bags, and found there was a fowl, or something of that sort, in it; I asked him where he came from; he told me he came from Southgate, and was going to Mr. Ball's, at Snow-hill; I told him he must go with me to the watch-house, and I took him to the watch-house, with the bags; they contained nine dead fowls; they were quite warm. I saw Mr. Freeman's servant at the watch-house on the Monday morning; he claimed them as Mr. Freeman's fowls.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked up the two bags in a ditch; I had not gone above two hundred yards before I was stopped by the patrol.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this house covered in? - A. Yes, it has been covered in about six weeks; the doors and windows were fast at one o'clock that day; when I had secured the prisoner, I went up stairs and found the lead cut from the gutter, and rolled up, it was removed about eighteen inches, it weighed about twenty-three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the prisoner employed about the building? - A. No, I don't recollect ever to have seen him before; I shall know it again when it is produced.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COOPER sworn. - I am a carpenter; I saw the prisoner cutting the lead, and rolling it up; my master was coming by, and ordered him to come down; I went up, and found the knife stuck in the cut of the lead, (produces it;) we found some nails in his pocket, which correspond with the lead. (Produces the nails and the lead.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A man employed me the day before to come there to a job, and I went accordingly, and not finding the man, I went to the top of the house to look for him, and while I was there, this gentleman came by.</p>

Yes, I saw Newlan come to Dunning's-alley, with a whip in his hand; the cart was in the alley; it was about six o'clock in the evening; Newlan, I am certain, was the man; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200028"/>cart stopped on the right-hand side of the way; there were two other men with him; one was Thomas Dolphin, and the other Bill Ivatt.</p>

               <p>Q. How were they drawing it off? - A.With a little brass cock and bullock's bladder; when they had drawn it off, they put it under some dung in the alley, by the side of the cart; they moved the dung, and covered it over again; then they fixed another bladder to the cock.</p>
               <p>JOHN AYRES sworn. - I am a tallow blanchard: On the 18th of March I was going down Bishopsgate-street, and within about twenty yards of the horses, in a cart in Dunning's-alley, I smelt a particularly strong smell of brandy; there were two casks in the cart; when I came even with the cart, I saw three men.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the bar? - A. Newlan is the man that drove the cart, the other I cannot speak to; when I was even with the cart, I endeavoured to get a sight of their faces, but on account of the casks I could not; as I moved, they moved the contrary way, till I got round the tail of the cart, and then they all three ran away; when I came up, I observed a brass cock annexed to the brandy puncheon, with a bladder; I examined the bladder, and found it contained brandy; I then took charge of the horses and cart, and stopped for about ten minutes; I sent for two constables, but could not find them; Newlan then came up, and asked me what business I had with the cart; he began to drive the horses and cart away, and used some abusive language; I told him, I would take him in custody as well as the cart; he endeavoured to drive the horses over me to drive away; I told him, he should not go on till I had got a peaceofficer; upon that, Mr. Matthews came up, a publican, and said, I had better let the man go, because the liquor would be seized, and he agreed to go with me; I asked Newlan for the permit, which he reluctantly produced, but it was so badly written we could not read it; Newlan said, he was going to Holborn-bridge with the liquor, and then to Bridge-street; when we came to Snow-hill, we called at the Vintner's porters, and from them we learned that the goods were going to Oxford-street, to one Mr. Harriott, and they did not choose to go with it, as they always racked it off.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that in the hearing of the prisoner? -- A. Yes; then I asked the porters where Mr. Harriott lived, and one of them told me the corner of Hanway-yard, in Oxford-street; Mr. Matthews accompanied me as far as the George and Blue Boar, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. In passing through Smithfield, did you meet a person of the name of Adams? - A. I did; he is a fellow-servant with the prisoner Newlan; he offered to take care of the cart till he got to Oxford-road, but the prisoner refused; Adams notwithstanding did join, and accompanied the cart; then I went on to Oxford-road, and left Mr. Matthews and Adams in care of the cart, as close to the George and Blue Boar as could be; I found Mr. Harriott's house, but not till after the cart had arrived there; I found the cart in the same state in which I left it; in consequence of what passed between the prisoner and Mr. Harriott, a coach was sent for to convey Mr. Harriott, myself, Mr. Matthews, and another person, into the City, to Messrs. Bridges and Reay's; the prisoner Newlan voluntarily offered to go behind the coach; we left Adams in care of the cart, and drove to Messrs. Bridges and Reay's; when we arrived there, Newlan was not to be found; I did not see him again that evening; I communicated all I had observed to the prosecutors.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to the Hon. Mrs. Gage; I was left at home when the prosecutor went out. About five o'clock I was setting my tray for dinner in the pantry; I thought I heard a foot in the passage below, which occasioned me to open the pantry-door; I opened the door, and saw the prisoner with a trunk in his hand; he was coming out of the hall into the passage leading to the area; as soon as he saw me, he set the trunk down, and asked me if the house was Lady Middleton's? (she lives in the same street, the name on the door;) I told him it was not; I asked him who he wanted, or what he wanted if it was Lady Middleton's, or who told him that it was; he said, some person in the street; I asked him again, and he said, dear me, I thought it was Lady Middleton's; then he went out, put the trunk down, and went up the area-steps; I followed him, and overtook him about ten yards from the gate, in the street; I caught him by the collar, and charged him with robbing our house; he said, my dear Sir, you must be mistaken, it could not be me; do you think a person like me would come down your area-steps to rob your house; I told him I was certain he was the man, and I insisted upon his going down stairs with me; he made no resistance, but went with me; I shewed him the trunk, and told him that was the trunk he had taken out of the servant's hall; he begged very much for me to let him go; I told him he might depend upon it I should not till my mistress came home; he said, he had a wife at the end of the street, who was waiting for him, and I was keeping him out of his business; he begged to go out to speak to his wife; I said, if he had any thing particular to say to her, he should, but he might depend upon it he should not go out of my hands; I went into the street with him; a woman came up who said she was his wife, and he said she was; she asked me if I thought a man of his appearance would come down to rob a servant's hall; I told her it mattered not what his appearance was, he was the man; she tried to loose him from me; a soldier was going by, and I charged him to assist me, which he did, and we took him down stairs again; I set the trunk before him, and desired the soldier not to let him go out of the house, and when my mistress came home, he was secured.</p>

I hope this will induce the Jury to consider it their duty to attend to his evidence; he left no address at the office from which I was committed, and gave no account of himself previous to the finding the bill of indictment."</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by facing? - A. The letters are all mixed promiscuously when they come to the Post-office, and the facing is, putting the face upwards, that the direction may be seen.</p>

               <p>Q. If you receive a letter to be taxed that contains money, is any thing particular done with respect to that letter or packet? - A. Yes; when we receive a letter that contains money or bills, we either take it, or send it to the clerk of the moneybook.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The letters, when they first come to the office, do not come to the eighth division immediately? - A. No; they go through several other hands.</p>
               <p>Q.Before they come to the eighth division, where the prisoner was? - A. They come to him in the first instance; when they come to the Post-office, in the first instance, he has to do with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go through other hands? - A. There are so many hands employed, that they may come through other hands.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say how it came into your possession? - A. I am not; I can tell that a person bought three sixteenth shares of lotterytickets at my office.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear from any thing upon that Bank-note, that you had a knowledge that that Bank-note was paid for those shares? - A. I am certain of it; there are the check numbers of the shares upon the back of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the description of those shares that you sold, for which you received that 10l. note? - A.The lottery number; 51; check, 202: 2046, the lottery number; check, 204: 40465, the lottery number; check, 257.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabout was it you sold these shares? - A. I think, from the 25th to the 31st of January.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a memory at all of the person who bought the shares? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you afterwards pay this Bank-note? - A. To the Equitable Assurance-office.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it afterwards that you heard any more of it? - A. On the 2nd or 3rd of February I received some directions from Mr. Parkin; I had informed him of my having sold these three shares.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the prisoner at the bar; do you know him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he made his appearance at your office? - A. On the 28th or 29th of March; the prisoner desired I would stop No. 51, having lost his pocket-book near Whitehall; he told me it was the only sixteenth there was in it; upon which I told him I was very glad he had called, having been placed in a very disagreeable situation concerning No. 51; I told him I must insist upon his going to Mr. Parkin, I took his direction before I mentioned any thing to him, and then I told him I was glad he had called, for I had been placed in a very disagreeable situation, and I must insist upon his going to Mr. Parkin with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about a Bank-note that had been paid to you? - A. I told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200036"/>had received a Bank-note for the share, No. 51, that had been stole; upon which he desired I would give him time to recollect himself.</p>
               <p>Q.About what? - A.About the Bank-note; he told me, when he purchased No. 51, he had received that week three 10l. Bank-notes; he did not object to go to Mr. Parkin, but begged I would give him time to recollect himself where he had received these Bank-notes; upon which I told him I by all means wished him to have time, this was either Monday or Tuesday morning, I don't know which; on Wednesday he called, and I went to Mr. Parkin with him; Mr. Parkin not being at home, I appointed the next morning at ten o'clock; he came at the time appointed very exact, but it so happened that my business was such, I could not go with him, and he went by himself.</p>
               <p>Q.When he first came, had he the usual dress of a letter-carrier? - A.When he came to stop the share he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about his purchasing the other numbers? - A. No; I told him I was afraid he had purchased some more shares.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that the first time he came to you? - A. Yes; I told him Mr. Parkin was the proper person to explain it to, and I did not enter into any further particulars with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the person who bought the shares was dressed in a letter-carrier's dress? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The first time he came was on the Monday? - A.It was on the Monday or Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q.You told him there was an enquiry on foot? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And that Mr. Parkin was the person to whom it was to be explained? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you that he had that very week he had purchased these shares received three 10l. notes? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore wished for time to recollect where he had got them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him time? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He had full warning, and an opportunity of making his escape? - A. Yes; I think it was Monday that he came first; it was on Thursday morning that he called upon me the last time.</p>
               <p>Q.He went with you on the Wednesday, and Mr. Parkin was not at home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the next morning he came to you, and you could not go? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Between each time having an opportunity of making his escape? - A. Yes; he said he was as innocent as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You have frequently occasion, in your office, to want change to give your customers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you not know it is very frequent to ask of the collectors of the letters to change notes for people in whole district they live? - A.Certainly; I have asked out postman for change, but not very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that it is a common thing? - A. I dare say it is.</p>
               <p>Q.Could any thing be more open or explicit than this man's conduct? - A.Certainly not.</p>

             sworn. - On the 31st of March last, the prisoner came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q.What day of the week was it? - A. I think it was on the Thursday; he said, he came from Mr. Carter, at Charing-cross, respecting a 10l. Bank-note that had been put off there for a lottery ticket; he said, that about a month or six weeks before, as near as he could recollect as to the time, he bought a sixteenth share of a ticket, for which he paid 1l. 3s. 6d. I told him it was very important, that he should recollect where he got the 10l. Bank-note.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he admitted that he had paid the 10l. note? - A. Yes; he said he could not tell where he got the 10l. Bank-note; I asked him if he did not know it was a regulation in the Office, that the letter-carriers should be able to say of whom they took Bank-notes, by writing something upon them; he said, he did, and he took a Bank-note of one pound out of his pocket that he had wrote upon that note his own name, and that that was the mode in which he wrote upon all Bank-notes that he received; he said, that was his usual mode; he said, the share was not for himself, but for one

             was a servant of Mrs. Lewis there; I asked him if he had sent the share to Carden, he said he had not; I asked him if he had registered the share, he said he had not; I asked him if he had advised the man of the purchase he had made, he said he had not; I asked him if he had bought it by Carden's direction, he said, no, he had bought it of his own accord for him; I asked him where the share was, he said he had lost his pocket-book on the 21st of March, between Parliament-street and the Post-office; that the pocket-book contained some redirected letters, a share of a lottery-ticket, a twopound Bank-note, a one-pound Bank-note, and two pawnbroker's duplicates. He again repeated that he had negociated the note at Mr. Carter's office for the sixteenth, still speaking of one sixteenth only. At this time I had not heard what had passed between Mr. Carter and the prisoner, except what the prisoner had himself said; but some time before that I had had communication with Mr. Carter, and from Mr. Carter I had learned there were three sixteenths sold at the time the 10l. note was negociated. I told the prisoner I understood there were three sixteenths bought; he said, he had only bought one sixteenth. Upon which I turned to some papers that I had upon the subject, and then I stated to him with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200037"/>more certainly than I had done before, that three sixteenths were bought at Mr. Carter's office. He then, for the first time, said, he had bought three sixteenths; that he paid 1l. 3s. 6d. for each share; he said, he thought he had said so to me at the first. I then thought it was necessary he should be taken before a Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe the main subject of your enquiry was, whether this man had paid for the lottery tranfaction with a 10l. note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That he had paid a 10l. note at that office, he did not attempt to deny; it might have been thought extravagant his buying three at once, and he concealed it? - A. He did conceal it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing of having lost a lottery share? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard there is some regulation in the Post-office, in order to enable letter-carriers to know from whom they receive Bank-notes? - A. I always put upon them the name of the person from whom I receive them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the general rule at the Post-office? - A. I have been given to understand that they are to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner has received that direction, or has conformed to it? - A. He has conformed to it for any thing I know; I have seen his name endorsed upon many Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Only his name? - A. Only his name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. Q. Do you know if the prisoner was in the habit of indorsing upon Bank-notes the name of the person from whom he received them, as well as his own? - A. I do not know that.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that it is very frequently done by very honest servants in the Post-office to give change for Bank-notes? - A. It is; they will oblige merchants and tradesmen with cash for notes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. Q. When they do that, if they conform to the regulation of the Office, they will write upon it the name of the person from whom they receive it? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. And they might omit such a thing? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Moss.) You are a clerk in the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the Bank ever issue two notes of the same date, same number, and same sum? - A. It must be a very great mistake indeed if they do.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200038"/>Q. Is it their practice to do it, or not to do it? - A. Not to do it; I dare say it does not happen one time in a million.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Carter.) Q. Was No. 51 ever brought into you? - A. No, it is a blank.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he break the window? - A.With his hand; I should suppose he had something in his hand, but that I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from him? - A. I was opposite to him, on the other side of the way: then they both walked away together; then they came past backwards and forwards several times.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you? - A. I stood where I was watching them; they came backwards and forwards by the shop-window several times, and looked in; afterwards they both returned, and Jones put his hand into the window, and took something out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see at that time what it was? - A. No; he put it under his coat, on the lefthand side, and then gave it to Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to him at that time? - A. About the same distance that I am now; I continued in the same situation.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Smith do with it? - A. I don't know; I desired Ferris to apprehend Smith; I apprehended Jones, the little one, and took him into a public-house, and Ferris brought Smith in about the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing produced in the public-house? - A. No; after they were secured, Ferris went out, and brought in a candlestick.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You are a patrol? - A. Yes; on Thursday the 17th of March, I had been with his Majesty to Covent-garden Theatre, with Gleed; we afterwards walked down Holborn, and observed the prisoners at the bar looking in at the shop of Mr. Fontaine, we crossed facing Mr. Fontaine's, to see whether they were going to do any thing, or what they were, and a little while afterwards, I saw the little one, Jones, break the window with his hand, or something in his hand; they passed on for a little bit, and then returned again; they walked backwards and forwards two or three times; I saw Jones take something out of the window that he had broke, and put it under his coat, he afterwards gave it to Smith; Gleed desired me to apprehend Smith, and he would take Jones; I then went very near him, and saw the candlestick in his left-hand, it looked like brass, or copper; I was then within about two or three yards of him, he saw that I was coming towards him, he stepped aside into the road-way, and shyed the candlestick at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it hit you? - A. No; he then ran away, I pursued him; he ran up against some gentlemen that were walking very fast, and I then apprehended him; I took him into a public-house directly, I was at the door before Jones and Gleed, we came up just at the same time; I handcuffed them together, and then went again to find the candlestick, and found it within ten yards of Mr. Fontaine's shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200039"/>Q.Near where he threw it? - A. Yes; there is a public-house, with some shutters under the window, he threw it against those shutters, and it rebounded into the road, where I found it; I heard it strike against the shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick it up yourself? - A. No, a young man said, here it is, and picked it up and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the direction in which the prisoner was going? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was it, from his throwing the candlestick at you, till it was found? - A. About five or six minutes; I went out directly that way, and handcuffed them; it has been in my possession ever since. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure, what he threw towards you, was a candlestick? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your window whole or broke when the lamps were lighted? - A. To the best of my knowledge, there was not a broken pane in that window, I broke one pane myself that evening, but it was subsequent to the prisoner being apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you receive an alarm from any body? - A.About half-past seven, or it might be eight, I am not quite certain, I was called down stairs by Ferris.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not heard any alarm, or missed any thing till Ferris came? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the window? - A. The window was broke and the candlestick missing, that I had placed there a few days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your's a sash-window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't remember having seen it that day? - A. No, I do not; but had it not been there, I should have missed it, because the vacancy was obvious.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the candlestick before he produced it to you? - A. I am not clear whether it was before or after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place, where you had placed it, within the reach of a man's arm? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he produced that candlestick did you know it? - A.On examining it, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that candlestick? - A. This is the candlestick, I have no doubt of it, it has my handwriting on it with ink, on the metal, both the cost and selling price.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is this the only window that you observed broke? - A. In that part of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any window broke in the shop, in any part of it? - A.Cracked, I dare say.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you put your cost and selling price upon all your candlesticks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sell them with the cost and the selling price upon them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold a great many of the same sort of candlesticks? - A. Yes, but not since I placed them in that place I missed it from.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you be able to swear to this from any other mark than the cost and selling price? - A. And the circumstance of my having placed it in a particular place, there had been a vacancy, and I found an odd one in paper, which I put in the vacancy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. How lately had you seen your shop-window before this alarm? A. I cannot say precisely, before I went up to tea.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you suppose? - A. It might be a couple of hours, I cannot say at all.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BRADLEY sworn. - I am a broker: On Tuesday, the 22d of February, I bought a chair of the prisoner; she brought it about two o'clock; she said she was in distress, and wanted to fell it; I gave her three shillings for it; I asked her if she had more, and she said she had a half dozen; I told her, if she would let me go and see them, I would give her more money for them than I could for a single chair, and she said I should have them all; I heard of my neighbour losing a chair, and I sent down to him; the next day she brought another chair, and I stopped her.(The chair produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

             came into the room, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you undress yourself, or get into bed? - A. No; when he first came in, I was sitting; I got up, having some suspicion of him, and he knocked me down; when I got up, he was gone; I missed my watch; I then ran down stairs to call the watchman; I did not miss any thing else at that time, it was a silver watch; the watchman came up, and took the woman to the watch-house; the watchman went in search of the man, and brought him to the watch-house within an hour afterwards, I knew him to be the man; his hat was drawn over his face more than people generally have; I am sure the prisoner is the same man, I have no doubt of it; I did not miss the other things till they were produced before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you your watch while you was in the room? - A. Yes, sometimes in my hand, sometimes in my fob, and sometimes in my waistcoat pocket, and I observed it once in the woman's hand.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200043"/>Q. You gave it her to look at? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you sober enough to know whether she gave it you back again, or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the other things? - A. In my breeches pocket; they were produced the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You admit very fairly that you was drunk? - A.Very.</p>
               <p>Q. So drunk, that you hardly recollected what you were about? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.The woman and you had been sometime together before you saw the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there a bed in the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You put the watch into the girl's hand to look at? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How long do you think you might have been amusing yourself with the woman before the man came in? - A.Four hours, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you give her any money? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not give her the watch, I dare say? - A.Hardly.</p>
               <p>Q.But you don't know what you did give her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you drink with her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you drink? - A.Rum.</p>
               <p>Q.How many glasses do you think you and your inamorata drank together? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Five or six? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you drank any rum before you came there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How much? - A. It is impossible for a man to say what he drinks.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to swear to the person of the man, drunk as you were? - A. Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen your watch since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The man's hat was pulled over his face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That gave you a better opportunity of observing him? - A.He had a down look, and I looked the more at him for that, because I had a suspicion of him.</p>

               <p>Q.Has the bag been found since? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Are you the daughter of Salmon Handfield? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you receive any money from your father on the 2d of April? - A. Yes, I received twenty pounds from my father; he took an account of it, but I did not; I put it in a bag, carried it up stairs, and locked it in a little drawer inside the bureau in the one-pair-of-stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do with the keys? - A. The keys are on a bunch; I put the bunch in the top drawer in the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q.When you had so done, what did you do with the room door? - A. I locked the room door, and put the key of that room door upon my bedroom table, which joins the other room; they are both backwards.</p>
               <p>Q.How near to where the prisoner's room is? - A.She lodged in the two-pair-of-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see her about the time you went into that room? - A.No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see the key of the room door again? - A. I came down stairs again.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you receive any more money from your father on the Monday? - A. Yes, about five in the afternoon, 3l. 10s. five seven-shilling pieces, and thirty five shillings, all in shillings: I took them up stairs, and put them in the same bag with the others; I locked the bureau, locked the door, and put the key upon the other room table.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon afterwards did you discover any thing respecting this property being missing? - A. About a quarter of an hour; my sister called me up stairs; I went up, and observed both bed-room doors open, and the bureau open, and the drawers in which the money was open.</p>
               <p>Q.Having been all locked when you left them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the money gone? - A. Yes, and the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? - A. I desired my sister to stay there, and I setched my father up; I then went up into Mrs. Hunt's room, and I asked her for the money; she said, what money, she knew nothing of it, I was joking; I told her I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200045"/>was not joking; it might be a very good joke for her, but it was a very bad one for me. My father then went up, and asked her, and said, you had better give it me, for if you do not, I will send for, Mr. Armstrong. Mr. Armstrong was sent for, and came almost immediately; he came up into the two-pair-of-stairs; we were searching about the room in different places, and saw the money lie upon the hearth in the bag, and Mrs. Hunt was sitting close by it upon a stool; the bag had been untied; she was sitting on a stool blowing the fire, and she sat as it might be by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it in the ashes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else there? - A. Yes; I found the three keys belonging to the double chest of drawers which were in my bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find them? - A. Lying by the side of the bag.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you know the notes again? - A. Yes; there is my hand-writing upon one of them, of the name of Jones; I put it on when I changed it for a person of that name. Two of the three keys that I found will unlock the bureau; Mr. Armstrong tried them in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Q.You had other lodgers in the house? - A.There are single men lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>Q.How many? - A. I cannot exactly say how many there were then; I believe two or three.</p>
               <p>Q.Had not the prisoner and you been out together just before? - A. No, we had been out at nine o'clock in the morning, and this was five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Who are the men that lodge in your house? - A.Working men.</p>
               <p>Q.What time do they go out? - A.Four or five o'clock in the morning, and come home at nine at night; they went out in the morning, and had never been home till after this happened.</p>

             sworn. - I was washing at Mrs. Pearson's house on the 25th of March; I had a lodging backwards; I came into the shop, and the prisoner was there; they were talking together something about leaving a jacket. Knowing she had not been well, I asked her if I should make her bed for her; she said, I might if I would; upon that I took a little table and chair that stood by the bed-side away, and the first thing I found was a pair of white pockets on the bed; they seemed very heavy; I took them up, and twisted the strings round, and put them upon the head of the bed; it was a small bureau bedstead, and pulled the clean clothes over the pockets; I had washed them the day before; I put the table and the chair in their places again by the bed-side; I stood a little, but as they were talking, I said, Mrs. Pearson, I will take the things that I have been washing, and carry in doors; she said very well; she asked me how long I should stop; I told her I should be back in the space of five minutes; I carried them in, and then I came into the shop again; I said, is the man gone; yes, said she; I said, Mrs. Pearson, are your pockets gone; she said, oh, d - n it, no. I threw them on the bed; I told her they were safe at the top of the bed; I went to look for them, and they were gone; she threatened to send me to jail, for I must have them.</p>

               <p>Q. And left them safe in the stalls? - A. Yes; the lock was rather out of repair, but by a sharp force the lock had effect; I saw them again about half past five.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you go to the stable again? - A. Not till the next morning about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you the first person there? - A. No, my master had been there; I found the horse and the mare gone.</p>

               <p>Q. What happened to them on Sunday the 20th of March? - A. I went to the stable about six o'clock in the morning, and observed the door upon the jar, within about four inches of the post.</p>
               <p>Q.Did it appear to you to have been forced? - A. No; I went into the stable, and missed the grey horse and the grey mare; there were eight horses in the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of missing them, did you pursue them on the Oxford-road? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q.What time did you set off? - A. About seven o'clock, I came up with them between Wheatley and Tetsworth, in Oxfordshire.</p>
               <p>Q.In whose custody did you find them? - A. The gentleman's at the bar, he was riding the grey mare, and leading the grey gelding.</p>

               <p>Q.What time was it? - A.About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the horses seem to have been rode hard? - A. I think the gelding had been rode very hard, for I saw the saddle mark, and the mark of the spur; I asked him what he was going to do with those horses, he asked what odds it was to me; I told him it was odds, they were horses that were placed in my care, and I must take care of him and the horses, till I could get a better answer; then I took hold of him by the collar, he got down off the mare, and asked what I was going at with him, and I told him, I wanted to know if he had any fire-arms, and he said, I was very welcome to feel; I felt down the side of his pocket, and found it was nothing but fancy, and I told him, he might get up upon the mare again, if he chose; he got up upon the mare again; there was a gentleman upon the road that assisted me, he put a stick through the prisoner's bridle; and between that and Wheatley, he told me he had bought them both of one Ward, a horse-dealer.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say where? - A. At Wycomb.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say which Wycomb? - A. High-Wycomb; he said, he gave thirty guineas, and a gelding; I asked him, if any person saw him pay for them; he said, there was no person up at the public-houses; then we went on to Wheatley, and ordered a post-chaise, but no chaise being to be got, I sent back to Tetsworth; then we came on to Oxford, which is six miles, and I enquired for a constable, and he was taken into custody; he said, he had made an appointment with Mr. Ward; at Abingdon-fair, and he was to meet him on the 20th of March.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you quite sure they were the two horses that were lost from your master's stable? - A. I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Your master has a great many horses? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.You are a watchman? - A. Yes: On Thursday morning, about twenty minutes after five o'clock, the prisoner passed me with a bag on her shoulder, at Seven Dials, coming out of Lumbercourt. My good woman, said I, what have you got in this bag? What is that to you, she says. I laid my hand upon the bag, and I thought it was wet linen, being so well packed. Where are you going with this bag, says I; What is that to you, says she, I am going home. Where is your home, says I, where do you live? I shall not tell you, says she. If you don't, says I, you must go to the watch-house directly. When I spoke about the watch-house, she dropped the bag, and ran across the street to get away from me, I suppose; I called my partner; we took her to the watch-house, and gave her up to the constable of the night to search her; I was by when the bag was opened.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any thing found upon her? - A. She dropped a dark lantern, and a key, a wrench, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200049"/>some combustibles, to get a light with. (Produces the bag.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bag she had across her shoulders? - A. Yes.</p>

I then called to the clerk in the outer office, who had made this abstract upon the prize-list, and asked him if he knew any thing of the particulars relative to it. He would not acknowledge receiving it. He was asked for his certificate from an officer on board the Hector; he produced one.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you got it? - A. Yes, (produces it); he immediately produced it, and put it in the hands of a young clerk in the office.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had discovered that this was not Mr. Rice's name, what did you do? - A. I carried it to Mr. Cooke; he came, and told him he was a rascal, and that it was a forgery; he was taken into custody immediately.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon after did you hear him describe himself by a different name? - A. At the third examination he called himself William Boulton.</p>

We went to the pawnbroker's, Mr. Harris, in Fleet-street, and found the thirtytwo diamonds in a box, taken from my shop; we use melting-pots in our trade, and I found the gold in one of them in his box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Don't you weigh your brilliants before you deliver them out? - A. No, I thought him honest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What form was the thirty-two brilliants to be worked into? - A. A crescent; he asked me if I should like that shape, which you will see the impression of in that box. (Produces a box.)</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot speak to a brilliant without knowing the exact weight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You usually buy them by weight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those - (shewing a box with a brilliant crescent) are those or not the brilliants you gave the prisoner? - A. I don't believe them to be, but I cannot swear they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the utmost value of one of those brilliants? - A.Perhaps eight or ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. It is near twelve months ago that you gave the prisoner the brilliants to work? - A. Yes, it might be.</p>
               <p>Q. You never gave him the gold? - A. No, he took that out of the skins.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible to remember the precise value of the diamonds you gave him twelve months ago? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner worked for himself, and sometimes for Mr. Gibson - did not he? - A. I did not know it till I made this discovery.</p>
               <p>Q. You ordered him to work the diamonds up at his leisure, and when you first accused him, he said he had some diamonds in pawn? - A. He acknowledged there were thirty-two diamonds of mine in pawn, and begged I would not expose him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not thirty-two diamonds in the box I shew you? - A. I cannot tell.</p>

The diamonds I am accused of stealing are my own, and those which my Counsel presented to the Court are Mr. Hobdell's; I pledged my diamonds, as I wanted money to make up a bill; it is customary for every one who works at home, to buy a few diamonds, as they are in the habit of working for a number of people, and are called upon to furnish a diamond or two now and then.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Queen's-square. On Thursday the 24th March last, at nine o'clock, I met the prisoner with this coat under Mr. Johnson's house, going from Mr. Johnson's towards his own in Duck-lane; I suspected him, and asked him how he came by the coat; he said he bought it the day before of a Jew, and had given eight shillings for it; I felt the pockets, and asked him if there was any thing in them; he said no; I then took the gloves out, and put him into Tothill-fields bridewell; next day I heard that Mr. Johnson had lost the coat; I went to him, and he came and swore to the coat.(The coat produced and identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going home, and bought the coat of a Jew, and gave eight shillings for it; going along the officer stopped me, and took me into custody, though I told him I had bought it.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Downend, in Gloucestershire; by desire of Mr. Emmet, I went on the 5th of March to look after his mare; I went round the country till I came to Henley-on-Thames, on the 7th, where there was a fair, I looked all over the fair stables, and every place where I thought horses were to be seen; I dined at a house called the Broad Gate; I could not find the mare; I went away about five or six o'clock on the 7th; I then went to many other places in my way to London; I was going over Blackfriars-bridge to look for the mare, the 16th of March, when I saw the prisoner riding the black mare with a halter, talking with a man who was walking by his side; I did not know the prisoner, but I knew the mare; I did not tell him so, but said are you going to sell this mare? he said yes sir, I am. What do you want for it? he said twenty guineas; I said it is too much; he said it is worth something; I said it is, which way are you going? he said this way; I said I will go back with you, for I have no objection to buy the mare of you; we came by Fleet-market, and he said we'll have something to drink; he wanted to stop; I said, if you come on further, there is a better place; we rode along together, and he wanted to stop on Snowhill; I said you had better go a little further;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200057"/>we rode together, and at the corner of Smithfield, he said, if you mean to buy the mare, buy her, for I will not go any further with you; I said, will you not give me leave to ride the mare; yes, says he, I will; I got off my horse, and got on his mare; I said, I would just ride round here, and be back in a few minutes, and I left my horse in his care; he said, he would call for six penny worth of gin and water; I rode across Smithfield, and round to the Ram Inn door; the gate happened to be shut; the ostler came with me to the public-house where I left the prisoner; I found a little boy holding my horse, but the prisoner was gone; I searched for him, but could not find him: I put the mare up at the Ram; about four o'clock next day, the 17th, Smith came to me, and in consequence of what passed, I went with him to the Red Lion, in Clothfair, Smithfield; Smith brought the prisoner from another house, through a passage, into the Red Lion; I said, how came you to run away, and trust me with the mare in that kind of way; says he, I was a little in liquor; says I, it did not appear so to me, I am glad to see you, I was afraid I should never see you again; says he, what's the matter? said I, you know what the matter is, it is a stolen mare; says he, I bought it at Henley fair; I said, I will not believe you, if you had been there, I must have seen you, where did you buy it there; he said, he bought it at Broad-gates; I said, if you had been there, I must have seen you, for I was looking for you, (the fair lasts only one day;) Smith was an officer, and I charged him with the prisoner, and I took the mare home to Down-end; I knew the mare well, having seen her every day; the next day I went before the Magistrate, and the prisoner was committed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you always been equally accurate in your story? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Before the Magistrate you never said a word about any conversation having passed between you and the prisoner about his having bought the horse at Broad-gates? - A. He told me so when we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the mare was lost was it that you saw the prisoner with her? - A. Eleven days.</p>

               <p>Q.What time of day was it? - A. Near seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no difficulty in riding away from you, he being on the black mare? - A. He might; but I should have tried my horse.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you leave to ride the mare? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he groggy? - A. He did not appear so.</p>

               <p>Q.Then the mare might have been fairly bought? - A. The prisoner said he had bought her on Monday evening at the fair, which was fair-day: I was there all day, and staid till it was night, about six o'clock; there were but few people there.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never said you did not believe the prisoner was the man who stole the mare? - A. I cannot say who stole her.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know you have said so? - A. I cannot say who stole her.</p>

She lived in St. Clement's work-house; she came to my room without my leave, liberty, or knowledge; I asked her what brought her and her box there; she told me there were twenty of them discharged out of the house; she was one, and she came to me to get a lodging; I told her I had no bed for her; but she begged so hard for me to grant her the liberty, that I gave her leave to sleep upon the boards that night.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you leave your box? - A. I locked it, and tried whether the hasp was safe, for fear of mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return to your room, after having left it at four? - A. Just close upon eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned, did you find that woman there, or was she gone? - A. I found her in the room, in the dark; when I came in, she was in a posture to come out of the room; I said to her, what! in the dark; she made a saint answer that I did not hear, and then she asked, me if I had any objection to let her go and make water; I told her to go; she whipped by me as quick as she could, and I never saw her again till she was taken the next day, Sunday, the 13th of March.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe he is in an extremely ill state of health, unable to help himself? - A. He is; I attended him, and helped him in and out of bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before this got any money for Mr. Tattersall from the bankers? - A. Yes, I got change for a check of 30l. the week before the prisoner was taken up, but I cannot say what day: I gave the change to my master, and afterwards put it into my master's purse; two 10l. notes, a 2l. note, and four ones.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a purse was it? - A. It was a red Morocco purse, with the head of Buonaparte upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you taken ill, so as to leave the care of your master? - A. No, but the prisoner assisted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200060"/>in taking care of my master, and pulled off his clothes of a night.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon after did you entertain any suspicion of him? - A. On Friday the 4th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, did any of the servants say any thing to him? - A. Yes; when I came down on Friday, the prisoner shewed me his watch-chain, and said, Matthew, don't I cut a swell here.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he a watch and chain before he came into the service of your master? - A. He had none; he told me he had put in half a crown at a raffle, and had won this watch; I asked him where it was, and he said in the Haymarket; he afterwards said it was in a street at the back of the Haymarket; I asked the landlord's name, and he said he did not know. As soon as I had taken my breakfast, I enquired after my master's purse, and my master missed it in the evening; I got some constables, and took up the prisoner on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q.When the constables came, did you hear him say any thing respecting the purse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present when any search was made? - A.The purse was found in the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was your master's purse or not? - A. Yes, I can swear it was my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner give any directions where to find it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.The prisoner is quite a lad? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he made use of this expression - Do not I cut a swell? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you sent for to take charge of the prisoner? - A. I was; on Friday, the 4th of March, in the forenoon, I took him in custody on suspicion of robbing Mr. Tattersall of notes to the amount of twenty-six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you took him before the Magistrate, did he say any thing respecting it? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you tell us any thing he said, had any body said any thing to induce him to confess, or threatened him? - A. No; when I apprehended him, I told him my business, and I searched his box, and found a great quantity of things; he did the box; I asked him how he came by such a quantity of things; he said, he had picked up a ten-pound note in Oxford-street; I said, the things must have come to more than ten pounds, and asked him how he came by his watch, and he said, he had won it at a raffle in the Haymarket; I asked him where, but he could not, or would not tell me; I then took him to Marybone watch-house; just before I got him to the lock-up house, he said, Oh dear, gentlemen, I will tell you how I came by it, I certainly did rob Mr. Tattersall.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you make any search for any thing, in consequence of what he told you? - A. Yes; he told me he had thrown the red purse down the privy; after I had put him in the watch-house, I got a candle and lanthorn, and found the pocketbook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew it to Mr. Tattersall's servant? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you kept it? - A. No, it was too bad to produce.</p>
               <p>Q.You found a great number of things in his box - did he say how he got them? - A. Yes; he gave me an account of things to the amount of the money within about three shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got there, did you acquaint him with the nature of the charge? - A. Yes, I did, and I asked him what money he had got in his pocket; he pulled out a five pound note, a guinea, and some silver - nineteen shillings, three six pences, and a half-guinea; he denied the charge then, and going along Cavendish-square, he turns his head to me, and says, Oh dear, oh dear, what shall I do. I told him it was not our duty to advise him what to do; I told him he must make that up in his own mind, and he said, "I did rob Mr. Tattersall;" I searched for the pocket-book with Lovett, and we found it in the necessary.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On Saturday, the 2d of April, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody for breaking open the house of Gover; I proceeded to search him, when he pulled out this book, which I took out of his hand, containing these keys, (producing five skeletonkeys;) this key the prisoner dropped out of his lefthand; I picked it up, and tried it in the room-door, and it locked and unlocked it as easy as the key of the door; this large pair of scissars belongs to Mrs. Gover; I looked at the drawers, and found they had been attempted to be opened; I picked up these scissars, and found that the scissars, in this shut situation, corresponded with the bruise in the bottom drawer which had been attempted to be broke open, and the top drawer, where the cloak was taken from, appeared to have been opened by the scissars in an open situation.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. That property is my own, and I cannot do without them; I was going to open an iron-chest in Tottenham-court-road, which I made for a Mr. Owen, who had lost the key; I was in the baker's shop when the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Denight. He told me he was a copper-smith.</p>

               <p>Q.One half-crown you can swear to? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Bly. When I searched him, I laid the money down in the Office; I turned my head, and he endeavoured to secrete the marked half-crown; I took it out of his hand; when I searched him, I found, concealed under his coat, this silk handkerchief. (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Huggins.) Look at that money? - A. I am perfectly sure this is the half-crown that I lost; it has the letter G upon it; the other I believe to be mine; it has a head on one side, and is plain on the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is my own money; I took it at market either the night before, or that day, I am not sure which; I buy fowls, and retail them out; Huggins said before the Magistrate he could not positively swear to that half-crown.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the man say he did not want to buy any thing, and upon his opening his mouth, being an Irishman, did you not call him a Vinegar-hill rebel? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was no such expression used by your servant? - A. Not that I heard of.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, was no such expression made use of? - A. I did not hear it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they do any thing to your mistress after they got in? - A. The little one drew a knife upon her.</p>

            , and I think she said Dennis Doughty, had broke two panes of glass, and forced the door open; it is a kind of half hatch; I then asked her where the bolt was.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the bolt was off? - A. Yes, the bolt was given into my hands by a servantmaid; one staple seemed to have been forced out by some means or other.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she tell you the men were? - A. Up a court just opposite; she persisted in it that we should take the charge; I explained to her why we could not take it; I then asked her if she had lost any thing; she said, no, she had not; Nowlan then made answer, let us go about our business; we were going about another felony in East-Smithfield.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.How came you to make such haste to go down? - A.Because Mr. Nathan said there was a disturbance.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't take persons to this watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was not quite right in Lee to take them to his watch-house? - A. I did not know they were in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Her husband had been to the Office for somebody? - A. Yes; as soon as we went into the house, she said she was very glad we came; I asked her what was the matter; she said, there were a parcel of Irish people had bred a riot about her house, and broke her windows; I asked her what was the cause of it, and she said there was one Leary, that lived right opposite, who always took an advantage when her husband was out of the way, to send these Irish people to breed a riot, and to ill treat her; I asked her what they had done; she desired I would lay hold of the candle, and see the window broke; there were two squares of glass, and likewise the bolt of the hatch; the staple that held the bolt was broke; I asked her whether they had stole any thing, and she said, no, I cannot say that they have; I asked her if they came into the house, and she said no, they had not come beyond the threshold; I asked her if she knew their names, or where they lived; she said, they lived in Whitehorse-court, of just opposite; she knew their names, and where they lived; she said, I insist upon your going and taking charge of them immediately; I told her no, I did not think I was justified, as I saw no peace broke; I told her to come up on Monday night to get a warrant, and I would apprehend them for her, and get them punished.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had told you a felony had been committed, you would immediately have apprehended them? - A.Immediately; Mr. Nowlan said, if you will not take charge of them, the patrols will; I replied, if the patrols do wrong, that is no reason I should; that is all I know till I saw them on the Monday morning at the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you they had knocked her down upon the counter? - A. No, she did not; we asked her several times if she had been robbed of any thing, and she said, no; I was called in before the Magistrate, and asked why I did not take charge of them for the felony; I was sworn, I declared, upon oath, she did not charge them with felony; and then she said it was Trott.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Do you know whether these men did really live in the court? - A. No, I never saw them, to my knowledge, till I saw them at the Office.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to tell me so at first? - A. I did not rightly understand the question.</p>
               <p>Q.You told the Magistrate she expressly told you she had lost nothing at the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor Trott? - A.Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had said the name of one was Reading, and the other Doughty, you must have heard it? - A. No, I might not, because she made high words.</p>
               <p>Q.If Trott had put that question to her, must you not have heard it? - A. I might not.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, before the Magistrate did she call them by their right names? - A. I was not in at the beginning of the examination; I did not know that they were there till the Magistrate called me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Magistrate only take one examination of them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He committed them, notwithstanding what you said? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the Magistrate say any thing to you at all? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. For what purpose? - A. To come and swear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200071"/>against these men; she told me, as I was an Irish person, and a Christian, a word from me would go farther than ten from her.</p>
               <p>Q. She is a Jewess? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her you would come? - A. No, I refused to come.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your refusing to come, did she do any thing? - A. When I found the purpose for which she gave it me, I threw the gown at her, and the petticoat she tore off my side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she keep you in her service, or did she dismiss you? - A. I left her place.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of not appearing against these men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you see the men in the shop, or see them attempt to take any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet this woman asked you to swear against them? - A. Yes; I said, they had never been in doors, and she said, Oh, you fool, there is no harm in taking an English oath, any more than kissing a thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, you left her service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. She told you it would be a special recommendation, not only that you were a Christian, but an Irish woman, you are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what religion are you? - A. I am a Roman Catholic; there was one of the panes of glass broke when I first came there, and the other she broke herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when this riot took place? - A. Yes, on Saturday night; these two men passed by the door, and her barker and herself stood by the door plying customers, and they wanted to bring these men in by force as customers, and the men refused to come in; they were rather in liquor to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in liquor? - A.These two men; then they said, they would come in to no d-d Jew's house; then she said, d-n them, let them go, for they are Irish rebels, they are Vinegar-hill rebels; then the barker went and struck the men, and the men struck the barker; upon that, my mistress and I got the barker in doors; then the barker broke the bolt off the door to get out to sight them, and my mistress broke one pane of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she break the pane of glass for? - A. She was trying to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who prevented her getting out? - A.The door was locked, and the barker broke the lock off the door to get out, and she broke the square of glass trying to keep the men in doors; she and I endeavoured to keep the barker in, and after she had broke the glass, she fell in a faint.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that for; nobody touched her? -- A. No; but she was frightened; there was nobody in doors but the barker, and I, and my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. So this little fellow, the barker, had a great desire to go out and fight these two great men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the officer when he came, that it was the barker that broke off the bolt, and not the man? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told Trott and Nathan it was the barker that broke off the bolt, and not the men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are quite sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had broke off the bolt, and got out, what did he do then? - A. We kept him in, we would not let him go out, and the men returned again.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you? - A. I was inside the shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see which way the men went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented the man getting out, when the bolt was off? - A. My mistress and I prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. But your mistress fainted away? - A. She came to again, she was not long in a saint; he only tore off one bolt; the door was not opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you went out of Court, was not you in the gallery? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So you told all this to the officers, Nowlan, and to the others? - A. No, I did not tell them nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell them the barker broke off the bolt? - A. Yes, that was the night the men were taken up; my mistress said they had not stole any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. But you told them, the barker pulled off the bolt? - A. My mistress herself told them so.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Nowlan.) Did this woman tell you the barker had torn off the bolt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And did her mistress tell you so? - A. No; my mistress told me the men burst it open; my master said, he could not confine the men, if he did not say they stole the coats.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q.Did you ever hear where these men lived? - A. No, I never saw the men till I saw them the day before yesterday; I saw one of them at the Old-bailey, and the other at Clerkenwell.</p>

Yes, with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200072"/>salesman stopping them as they passed by, asking them to buy cloths; they positively told them they wanted none; then Mrs. Nathan walked forward, and said they were Irish rebels; upon that the barker said, if they were, he would cut their heads off; they went past, and then one of them returned and asked who there was that would cut their heads off? upon that the shortest of the two prisoners pulled the other, and told him to come away, and with pulling him, the tall one fell down; then the barker came out and said he was not afraid of them, he had licked four or five, and was not afraid of any of the b-y Irish set.</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. I was the master of a collier at the time this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live in the neighbourhood of Rosemary-lane when you are in London? - A. I live opposite the prosecutrix's door; the two men at the bar were passing; Levy plied them in the usual way, do you want any clothes? they said they did not want any; he heard their tongues were Irish, and said you b - y Vinegar-hill rebels; his mistress came out, and said we will give the Irish crew their due, or something to that purpose; the men enraged at the expression returned, and asked for what reason they called them rebels; the man very properly could make no reply, and they asked him again why he called them Vinegar-hill rebels, and they could like to have satisfaction for what he had said; a scuffle of course (the men being enraged) ensued, and they struck the man; he told them he had licked half a dozen Irishmen before, and he was sure he could lick half a dozen now; the tallest of the men made a blow at him, and he ran in doors.</p>
               <p>Q. The barker did not strike him? - A. Yes; the barker returned the blow, and ran in directly.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observation you had, and upon the oath you have taken, were they ever in the shop? - A. No, they never were.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What became of them afterwards? - A. They left the house, and went into a public-house, called the Fourteen Stars; I saw them go in myself.</p>

               <p>Q. This brave young chap ran away at the first blow being aimed at him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not attempt to get out after them? - A. Yes, after he heard they were gone away he grew bold, and endeavoured to get out; I heard the servant say he had wrenched off the staple.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked of being master of a collier? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you continue in the same trade? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope you have not got into the barking trade yourself? - A. My constitution would not permit it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got into the barking trade? - A. I don't understand that term; I am a salesman.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard the word barker then? - A. I do not understand the meaning of it; I am a salesman at Sparrow-corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that? - A. In the city of London.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Rosemary-lane? - A. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it ten yards from Rosemary-lane? - A. I never measured the distance.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep a shop there? - A. No, I am only employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are the very thing they call a barker; this very respectable master of a collier carries clothes in a bag? - A. I stand in my master's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop does he keep? - A. A clothes shop, at Sparrow-corner.</p>
               <p>Q. I rather think you are brother-in-law to a person of the name of Leary? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Leary, and the prosecutor of this indictment, are upon very bad terms? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. Q. Sparrow-corner is at the end of Rosemary-lane, is it nor? - A. It joins it.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a contlnuation of the same street from the Minories? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners, did you ever see them before? - A. I saw them once before; I am Mr. Nathan's next door neighbour; the prisoners were coming along, and Nathan's man plied them, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200073"/>asked them if they wanted to buy any clothes; they said no, they had no money to buy any; Nathan's man wished them to come in and look at some clothes, and took hold of their arms, and wanted to pull them in doors; they told him they would not go in, for they positively did not want to buy any; they went away, and came back again a little way, and then Nathan's man put up his hands and blew most horrid expressions through his fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they ever go into the shop? - A.They never went into the door at all: Mrs. Nathan came out, and said let them go, they are Vinegar-hill rebels; they might have been gone ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, when they came back again; Nathan's man put up his hand to his mouth, and abused the men again; the mob gathered, and Mrs. Nathan got a rattle from somewhere; when Mr. Nathan came home, she gave him the rattle into his hand to spring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.There was no scuffle ensued before Mr. Nathan came home? - A. Yes, there was, because Nathan's man blew after them, and made use of horrid expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any battle at the door at all before Mr. Nathan came home? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you were close to Nathan's house, did the woman desire you to go into the court to look after the clothes? - A. No, they did not; Mrs. Nathan said, she had been robbed; I asked her of what, and she said, she could not tell till the articles were looked over.</p>

(Produces them).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Monday before the Friday, I took a pair of boot legs to cut out for myself; I had not an opportunity of cutting them out till the Friday, and because my master should not find it out (as he does not like to see his men cut out work for themselves) I put them upon my masters own boot legs; I have been in business for myself, and these are part of my old stock.</p>

On Monday the 28th, I had information that a woman was stopped with a parcel of goods under her arm; on the Tuesday morning, about eleven o'clock, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200074"/>them at Worship-street; I knew them to be my property; I never saw the woman near my premises; the woman prior to this happening, had been a customer at my house several times, about a week or ten days before I lost the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were removing your goods at this time into another house? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the girl was taken? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether, at the time she was taken, she did not say she was desired to carry these things for two men who ran away? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>- FITZGERALD sworn. - I am a watchman, in the parish of St. Luke's: On the 25th of March, about a quarter before eleven o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Play-house-yard; on the Friday evening, I saw two men come up, one after the other, there might be about two yards difference one from the other; they seemed rather alarmed when they came out of the yard; I did not see any thing upon them; at the same distance came the prisoner at the bar, and perceiving a bundle under her left arm, I caught hold of her, and asked her what she had got there, she told me that she had nothing; I felt on the outside of her cloak, and I found there was a bundle of some kind; I said she must have stolen it, or somebody else; I did not take it from her; one of the men immediately turned back, I thought his meaning was to liberate the prisoner, and therefore I sprung my rattle for assistance, and the man made his escape through Play-house-yard; I took the woman to the watch-house; she said, on going along, and at the watch-house, she was employed by three men to carry that bundle; I saw but two of them; that she was offered a shilling to carry it to some house in Golden-lane. I know no further about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The two men got away? - A. Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not give you to understand, that the men of whom she said she had the bundle, were the men that had ran away? - A. No, she never said a word about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did these three people follow one another, had they any conversation together, and did you hear them talking together? - A. I did, very familiarly, and laugh together; I never saw the bundle in any persons hands but the prisoner's; I left the bundle at the watch-house, in the charge of the officer; I should know it again.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FRENCH sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 25th of March, about a quarter before eleven in the evening, I heard a rattle spring, and I went to give assistance, and there I saw my brother watchman and the prisoner together, and we took her up to the watch-house; I saw a bundle under her left arm; there was in that bundle some muslin handkerchiefs, and some cotton and linen handkerchiefs; we took her from the watch-house to the New-prison; the goods were left at the watch-house in the hands of

               <p>Q.For what purpose did he give it you? - A. He gave it me to huy half a dozen cups and saucers, which I bought.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I don't know whether you were acquainted with the fact, of some cups and saucers being broke? - A. Yes, and they were to replace those that were broke.</p>
               <p>Q.Isael, the Jew, you say, gave you a one pound note, and Warren the other? - A. Yes, and it is impossible for me to say which of the notes I gave to Mrs. Groffnell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Look to those gentlemen, and recollect what my Lord has said to you, respecting your own situation - how soon after you left Newton-street, did the prisoner give you a one pound note to purchase some cups and saucers? - A. I cannot exactly say how long.</p>

               <p>Q. How near were you to Groffnell's door, when he delivered to you the one pound note? - A. I cannot exactly say, I was near it, I dare say I was in sight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he direct you to go to that shop to buy his cups and saucers? - A. Not directly to that shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How many paces? - A. I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you further than you now stand from me? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Further than the Gentlemen of the Jury? - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the note which you received, in your hand, till you delivered it to Mrs. Groffnell? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it then, if you did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200077"/>not keep it in your hand? - A. I put it into my pocket-book which had the other note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Isael's an older note than the other? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you deliver the cups and saucers first to Warren? - A. I fancy it was at the door, the fatigue was not a great deal; then I proceeded with him to the glover's.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you changed Isael's note? - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you any doubt the one that you passed at the glover's, was Isael's? - A. I cannot say, I speak to the best of my knowledge; I passed two as I have already informed you, Mr. Warren's was one, and Mr. Isael's was the other; I had only two notes in my posession, I am telling the exact truth.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible to go on any further, a great suspicion hangs about this woman, as to the manner of giving her testimony, but the first step in the cause is to identify the note, she will not undertake to say that that is the note she gave to the china woman. <rs id="t18030420-66-verdict354" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at your house in March or April last? - A. I think it was the latter end of March, or beginning of April, I saw him at the Boar's Head, in Exeter-street; he had something to drink, but I cannot say what it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he pay for what he had? - A. Yes; he asked me for change of a pound note; I had not the note in my hand; I said, be so good as to put your name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce a note? - A. He had the note, as far as I recollect, in his hand; he threw the note on the table.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he put his name upon it? - A. I did not see him; I told my sister, who was in the bar, to be so good as put down a pen and ink for Mr. Gregory.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200078"/>Q. Did you know his name then? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.He was no stranger? - A. He used the house as other customers did, backwards and forwards; I think my sister picked up the note, and put it in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your sister bring the pen and ink? - A. I turned my back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or your sister take up the note to put it into the till? - A. I think it was my sister.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you or your sister take that note, or any other note, with the name of Gregory upon it? - A.Really I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether it was you or your sister? - A. I don't know that either of us did; it was a good while after before I heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that any thing happened about this note? - A. The note came in for payment to the Bank in May; I heard of it about the month of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Mr. Gregory, and had you any conversation with him about this note? - A. When I heard there was a note at the Bank with his name upon it, I asked him about it; I told him there was a note of his at the Bank stopped, with his name on it, and asked him if he would pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not threaten to summons him for it? - A. I said it was very hard that I should lose the note.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you settle it? - A. I dealt with Mr. Gregory; he sold linen; I took about thirty shillings worth of linen, and I paid the difference.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I apprehend this was above a twelvemonth ago? - A. I hardly recollect the circumstance at all, it is so long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was a person using your house at different times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And continued to use it afterwards, did not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no account of the note, or put any name upon it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was put into the till, by whom you don't know? - A. I believe it was my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps taken out of the till, and put among a hundred notes? - A. I cannot say particularly a hundred notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever notes he gave you might be put among hundreds? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. I am inspector of Bank-notes in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect speaking to the prisoner at the bar respecting his having uttered that note at Mrs. Goodall's, in Exeter-street? - A. Mr. Gregory, the prisoner at the bar, came down to the Bank to look at the note; I was present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was any Magistate present at the time? - A.There was not. The prisoner at the bar, Gregory, looked at the note, and said, that this was not his hand-writing; he brought a bit of paper down with his hand-writing upon it, and address; he said, that he had not passed a onepound note at Goodall's; if it was a Bank-note, it was a two-pound, it could not be a one; but he could not recollect changing any.</p>
               <p>Q.When was this? - A. I really don't know; I have made a memorandum in June last.</p>
               <p>Q. Not long after the note had been stopped payment? - A. No great while after; he denied then having uttered a one-pound note at Goodall's, if he had it must have been a two-pound; he said, that the writing upon it was not his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It is frequently the habit of persons who receive notes from others, to write the names of the persons from whom they receive them? - A.Frequently.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Were you groom to Mr. Trent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you first become acquainted with the prisoner at the bar, Gregory? - A.Sometime before July last.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any transactions with him, at what time, and of what nature? - A. Yes, I had; I was first introduced to him by another servant, Henry Nelland; Gregory bought a coat and a pair of boots of me, and paid two pounds for them. Upon the 12th of July I went off to Ireland with my master, and did not return till the 13th or 14th of November. My master took Lodgings in New Bond-street, No. 157.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner? - A. I suppose about the 17th to that of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200079"/>20th of November; he called upon me, and gave me a card of his linen drapery; he was what you call a duffer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he call upon you? - A.In Bond-street, at the house; he told me he was very sorry he did not know me before I went to Ireland as he did then; he said, if he had, he would have given me something else than the two pounds which he had given me for the clothes, and that I might have had some pounds in my pocket on the road by it. I asked what it was; he told me he would call next morning, and let me know, between ten and eleven o'clock; accordingly he did, with Warren in company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Warren before? - A. I had seen him with Gregory, but did not know him by name.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then? - A. He wrapped at the door, the maid came up stairs, and I desired her to send them down; Gregory and I went into the cellar of my master's house, and Warren stood at the corner of the area, looking down; he put his hand in his waistcoat pocket, and pulled out a onepound note, and asked me if I would like that and another in the place of the two-pound note he had given me for the clothes before I went to Ireland; he said, if he had known me as well then as now, he would have given me the two one-pounds notes in the place of that.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you make to that? - A. I said, I was perfectly satisfied with it; he told me he could let me have twenty of them for ten pounds, so I kept the pound note; I asked him if it was safe to pass it; he said it was perfectly so; he said, he would call upon me in a short time; they then left me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner again? - A.About two or three nights afterwards, he called at my stables in North Portland Mews, in Baker-street, in company with Warren; my wife was up stairs; Gregory went up stairs to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Warren and you had some transaction below? - A. Yes; I had notes in my hand when Gregory came down.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of notes, and how many? - A.Nineteen one-pound notes, and the one he gave me made twenty.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In his first conversation he left the one-pound note with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in the stable Warren gave you nineteen one-pound notes, together with the one-pound note that Gregory had given you, made up the twenty-pounds? - A. Yes; Gregory came down; we did not settle about the price of them; he asked me eight pounds for the twenty notes, so I agreed to give him between five pounds and eight pounds, and I gave him six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you pay for them at that time? - A. Yes, I did; I paid it to Warren, in the presence of Gregory.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you pay that six pounds? - A. It was in pound notes. I asked Warren who it was that made them (Gregory was by) he said, that he made every halfpenny worth of the things belonging to them except the plate, and that Gregory filled them up; Gregory then said, "when I am sober and free from drink, I can forge any man's hand in England;" at the same time I observed to him, that the numbers on one of the notes were very badly done; he put his hand into his pocket, and took out about twenty good Banknotes, and he shewed me one as badly written as the one he had given me, and he said, when they did them badly, he should do the same. Nothing more passed at the time; then they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see Gregory? - A. Warren then brought me a bedstead, for which I paid him eight and thirty shillings. My master was going to Bath after Christmas, and Gregory called on me to borrow 15l. of me; I told him that I had it not by me at the time. My master and I went off to Bath the day after Christmasday, and returned in a fortnight from that day to London; Gregory applied to me a very short time afterwards, about the 15th of January, for the 15l. again, and told me that he would give me a respectable tradesman's promissory note for 15l. and I told him, I would give it him, and I gave him a bill of exchange upon Mess. Cowan and Son for 15l. 6s. and he returned me the six shillings; he gave me a promissory note of a person of the name of Phillips, Hungerford-market; I lost the note in two days after.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see Gregory? - A. Not till about five or six nights after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that you saw him again? - A. I suppose about a month after; he called at my stables first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him in? - A No, my helper, a person of the name of Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come alone, or Warren with him? - A.They were both together; they came to the Worcester-Arms public-house, the corner of the Mews.</p>
               <p>Q. You found from the conversation with them that they had been at your stables? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What passed between you and Warren there? - A. The conversation was about this 15l. note; I said, I was sorry I had lent Gregory the money, for I wanted it; then Warren told me, in the presence of Gregory, he would let me have plenty of money. I asked him why he did not give it to Gregory; he said, that he would as soon give it me, and asked me then to take 147 of these notes for 30l. and that he would deduct the 15l. which I had lent to Gregory; I told him, that I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200080"/>pass any of them, and he said I should be very safe in passing them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who said that? - A.Gregory and Warren both, that I should be perfectly safe in passing them, as one night he and Gregory went to Vauxhall, and passed near twenty forged notes in the Gardens; on another night, at a dinner at Highgate, they changed a five-pound note for a farmer; Warren gave him three and Gregory two bad notes; and that Warren said, at the same time, he had been six years at it, and never met with a disappointment. Then the next time we met again, I went from Bond-street to Gregory's house; it was about a week after that.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was it? - A. It was in the latter end of January, or the beginning of February, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to Newton-street? - A. I called on Warren and Gregory both, to let them know I had lost the note.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find them both there? - A. I only found Warren.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing in the house? - A. Yes, I did, in the workshop of Warren (it was a front garret) I saw a machine fixed there.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose name was on the door? - A.Gregory's name. The first thing I saw were these irons fixed on a table; they were high irons fixed on a table with screws.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the machine there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the trough? - A. Yes, and there was a wheel in it, and something at the bottom white, like thick milk; there was a wooden press, and I saw a copper-plate lay beside it upon the bench.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what was upon it? - A. Yes; it was; "promise to pay."</p>
               <p>Q. That was to impress these one-pound Bank-notes you saw? - A. Yes; I asked him where he got it. I saw some notes ready, all but the manuscript part; he shewed me one of those notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him again? - A. A short time after I saw Warren and the prisoner together at the Worcester-Arms; there was some company in the parlour (the very place where they always sat); we had two pints of ale, and, after some conversation, (I was in a hurry to go to my master,) Gregory and Warren told me that they could not at that time let me have what I wanted, and the next day he called upon me, and left a message with the helper, as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, what did you do? - I went to the Worcester-Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner there? - A. Yes, sitting in the same place; after sometime every body went away but we three, when Gregory got up, and put his back to the door, and said, he had the notes fastened with a pin between the frame of the table and the leaf; he said he did not care a d-n for all the Bow-street officers in London; the notes were fastened at another table where the company had been sitting; we then turned down the Mews, and he gave me the notes, and desired me to count them when I got into the stable. These were the fifty notes which I should have told you of before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made any agreement with Warren for the fifty notes? - A. No; the agreement was made for 147, and the fifty were in part of the 147. Warren and Gregory both said, that whenever they went out to pass notes of this description it was at night; that they took the pricker they marked the wood with, and they rolled up their notes in a lump of brown paper, and went into the necessary of the public-house, and fastened there backwards under the seat of the necessary, the back part where it was clean, with this pricker, and that they would come in every now and then from time to time as they wanted a note, as they could not be hurt if one only was found at a time upon them. Then Gregory called on me shortly after.</p>
               <p>Q. They gave you fifty notes in the yard to count them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any payment upon them at the time? - A. No, we parted; Gregory came to me at the stable about four days after, I think, and told me that he had passed a forged note to a publican, and to take care to destroy any papers in my room with his name upon them for fear of a discovery, for he had been brought to the Bank, and examined before an Inspector; that the Inspector put out his hand, and asked him whether that was his name, and that he had said it was not. We parted then.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened upon denying his name at the Bank? - A.Nothing; he was set at liberty.(Note produced and read.)</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see Gregory? - A. Shortly after that I saw Gregory again.</p>
               <p>Q. What then passed? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and Gregory about what had passed with Warren? - A. No, nothing, that I can recollect at the present.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing with respect to that subject? - A. Yes, there was about the ninety-seven notes that remained; Gregory told me, that he would send Warren with the remaining ninety-seven; accordingly he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards? - A. I think it was about three weeks; but he said he had broke the handle of his machine, or that I should have had them before; I would not take the notes at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Gregory had told you about the publican's story? - A. Yes; I told him I had not passed any of the others; but I told him of a person who had passed some, and I would bring them together if he chose it; he said, he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200081"/>not see him - that bringing too many into a thing of the kind, always made it turn out very bad; then he went away in a passion, because I would not take the remainder.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you afterwards, and when, see Gregory? - A.This man and I went in company to Gregory's house, but they were all out.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you afterwards see Gregory? - A. No, not till after he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever make any payment to Warren with the Bank-notes you received from your master? - A.All that I paid Warren was in money I had received from my master, Mr. Trent.</p>
               <p>Q.Now state what these payments were? - A. The first payment was four guineas in gold, and a one-pound note; the second payment was a twopound note, with my master's name upon it, and a one-pound note, which in all made eight pounds four shillings, and I owes the remainder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.How long have you been in custody-yourself upon this charge? - A. A month to day.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it that you first became acquainted with Gregory? - A.Before I went to Ireland, the 12th of July.</p>
               <p>Q.How long before last July - was it a month or two? - A. It was not a month, I am sure it was not a month.</p>
               <p>Q.You are quite sure, when you saw this press we have heard of, Gregory was not present? - A. No; Warren was.</p>

               <p>Q.How many conversations at different times had you about forged notes? - A. That I cannot tell; it was a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q.Though you did not pass any yourself, you gave them to others to pass? - A. Yes, another person did pass them.</p>
               <p>Q.You told him to do it? - A.No; he told me he was out of place, and he should be glad to get them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell him they were forged notes? - A. I told him what they told me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did you ever get delivered to you? - A. I got first 20, and then 147 after, in three different times.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon, you knowing them to be forged, did you give any intelligence to any Justice about it? - A.Not at all till I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q.So you had been receiving 20 and 147 notes, which you knew to be forged? - A. I did not know them at the time.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did you know them to be forged? - A. I cannot tell how long; at the first conversation I was told that they were forged.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell any Justice or constable about it the first time you were taken up? - A. I will tell you the reason of that; Warren told me, in the presence of Gregory, that if this man was taken, and I came forward, I was sure to be hanged - that I certainly would be hanged if I was to own to it.</p>
               <p>Q.How many examinations did you attend, before you were good enough to give that account to the public what you have been telling to-day? - A. I suppose three. He told me, at Liverpool a person was taken up for passing forged Bank-notes, Warren and Gregory both - that he had too guineas in gold in his pocket, and 200l. in forged notes, and he suffered to go through his trial rather than make a discovery, and that he was transported for fourteen years; and this very man wrote me a note in the prison in cold Bath-fields; I destroyed the note that the prisoner wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Gregory's hand-writing? - A. It is very hard to know it; I know the note was Gregory's hand-writing, because he wrote it with a pencil, and sent it up stairs to me; he requested of me, whatever I might say of the other man, to say nothing about him.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you seen him write often? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You thought it was a better thing, when you were likely to be hanged yourself, to turn King's evidence? - A. No; Sir Richard Ford, in a very feeling manner, told me, that Warren and Gregory were in the habit of doing those things for a great while back, - that a great many knew of it, - that it was a pity to let such people escape, and that it was in my power to give evidence against them, which I did; I thought I was in duty bound to do it.</p>
               <p>Q.You know, by giving that account, you would be saved yourself? - A. No, I have no purpose at all.</p>
               <p>Q.You think you shall be hanged now? - A. I don't know it.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, don't you believe, in conlequence of the evidence you have given to-day, you shall be saved from prosecution? - A. I don't know whether I shall be saved, or hanged, myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. You have been asked how long you have been in custody; had you ever been in custody for the Bank-note passed to Mrs. Goodall? - A.No; Sir Richard took me over, and swore me to my own confession.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that what you said, or meant to say, to this gentleman? - A.Certainly it was.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole account you have given here of the connection with those persons, is the truth? - A. Yes. (The press and trough produced.)</p>
               <p>- CROKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.Were you the officer that searched the lodgings at No. 14, Newton-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose name was upon the door of that house? - A. Mr. Gregory's.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find those things, now produced, in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200082"/>Q.Tell us what part of the house you found the articles in? - A. In the front garret.</p>
               <p>Q.How were they placed when you first saw them? - A.This wheel was found in pieces.</p>
               <p>Q.How was the press and the table? - A.These two were found in one corner, but all the materials were found in the room, excepting these three things; one was found in the cellar window, halfmoons they are called; the other two were found under ground in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I should have supposed, but for what you have explained now, that all these things were ready in the state in which they are now? - A.They were all in one room, excepting these things.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the press in the condition it is now? - A.Not as it is now; it was not put together upon the table.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. It was on the Tuesday morning, the 29th, when you took these things? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q.O'Loughlin was taken up upon the 28th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GARNETT TERRY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am engraver to the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that Bank-note; is that Bank-note engraved from the plates of the Bank of England? - A. It is not.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you suffciently acquainted with the signatures? - A. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you employ any other engraver? - A. I am the principal; it is not from any of these plates.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you conversant with the mode of making paper? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you look at that through and the wheel; is that an instrument that might be used in the making of paper? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. The materials of which paper are made, are first reduced to a pulp? - A. Yes; I found the pulp sticking about the corners of the trough.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the use of the wheel? - A. It appears to me to have been used as the hog for separating the pulp, and keeping it from floating.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you look at these instruments; would they be useful in impressing an impression on a plate? - A.They might, these two irons might; these two half-moons are for a printing-press.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You are not a paper-maker, but an engraver belonging to the Bank of England, and you are capable of knowing that these things might be employed in papermaking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In all papers? - A.Just so.</p>
               <p>Q.Might not they be used for any other purpose as well as making paper? - A. They might.</p>
               <p>Q. That may be just as well used for copypaper and demy paper? - A.Not demy; it must be small paper.</p>

               <p>Q.When was it you missed any thing? - A. On the night of the 24th of February, I left the stall about half-past nine at night; I locked it up, and went home; I missed two pair of old shoes, and an odd one; some pieces of leather, a memorandum-book, and a sponge; I had left them safe locked up with a padlock.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HEBERDEN sworn. - I am a watchman; on the night of the 24th of February, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the stall; I did not see him go in; I followed him to the corner of Gerrard-street, and then I saw him throw something away into the open street; I followed him, and laid hold of him; I sprung my rattle for assitance, and took him into custody; I saw him drop this iron into an area.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that before he had dropped the things, or after? - A.Afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what it was at the time? - A. I did not; I knocked at the door, and the people of the house told us to come in the morning; I went between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you call that piece of iron? - A. It is what they call a center-bit.</p>
               <p>JOHN NARBORN sworn. - I went to the assistance of Heberden; I saw the prisoner drop the property, and I saw him throw something into the area; I picked up some old shoes, some leather, and a memorandum-book (produces them.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me throw any thing into the area? - A. Yes, I head it drop.</p>
               <p>(To Collins.) Q.Are those your shoes and leather? - A. Yes, they were my own; I always take my customer's work home with me of a night; the memorandum-book is a book I keep against my landlord, when I pay my rent.</p>
               <p>Q.How did your stall appear to be broke open? - A. The watchman came to me, and told me my stall was broke open; about half past seven o'clock I went and found the pastlock was taken off, and carried away.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it forced off? - A. No, I think it was taken off by a picklock-key, for there is nothing wrenched.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. On the 7th of February, I came from a village in Northumberland, where I had been to see my mother,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200084"/>who is ninety-two years old; I continued there eighteen months, and practised my profession, which is that of a hair-dresser; it did not answer my expectations; I arrived in London on the 7th of February, at near twelve o'clock at night; I called at an Alamode-beef shop, to refresh myself, where I staid about fifteen minutes; I went with intent to procure a bed, in Green-street, Leicester-fields, where I had lodged before; as I got to the corner of Gerrard-street, a man walked very fast by me, and dropped something; I called to him, but he made me no answer; the watchman came up, and laid hold of me; I told him which way the man was gone; he said he had got me, and that was sufficient for him, observing with a great oath, that he should lose his place if he had not somebody, for he was already upon his good behaviour.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Heberden.) Are you sure you saw him come out of the stall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you say you was upon your good behaviour, and must take up somebody? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.You never lost sight of him after you got out of the stall? - A.Not at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. It was not a moon-light night, was it? - A.No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q.How far were you from him? - A.About fourteen yards.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you fee any body else near him? - A.There were several people passing.</p>
               <p>Q.You saw him come out of the stall, you saw him throw the things away, and you never lost sight of him? - A.Never.</p>

               <p>GEORGE COWEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.You are a Thames-Police surveyor? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200085"/>Q.On the night of the 24th of February, were you on the river? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.About what time were you off the Hamburgh tier? - A.About seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any wherry? - A. Yes, I saw the two prisoners in a wherry, rowed by a boy, coming from the bows of the Henrietta, lying in the Hamburgh tier, St. Catherine's.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see a lug-boat lying against the Henrietta? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How far was the wherry from the lug-boat when you first saw her? - A.About half a boat's length.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you pursue the wherry? - A.My boat shot past her; I did not see any thing in the boat at first; we pursued her; just as we came up, I saw a handkerchief under the thwart, where Amos was fitting, and he took the handkerchief and shoved it down under the water.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he put his arm in the water? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the handkerchief appear to be full or empty? - A.It was full of something.</p>
               <p>Was it a common pocket handkerchief? - A. Yes; I called out to him not to put it overboard, but he took no notice of it; I said, do not throw it over-board, perhaps it is something I may not seize; people are foolish enough to throw biscuits and bees over-board sometimes; Ellis was on the starboard side; I saw him hand a bag over the boat's gunwhale, what they call a jemmy bag, they hold from fourteen pounds to half a hundred weight of coffee or sugar; this bag I suppose would hold about thirty pounds; he shoved it over-board; I went up along side, and desired them to come into my boat.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you search Ellis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you find upon him? - A. I found in his right-hand breast pocket, a small bag of raw coffee (produces it.) There is better than two pounds of it; when I had taken that from him, he put his hand over the boat's gunwhale, and I thought he was going to put something else overboard, and I wrenched a gimlet out of his hand; I found the head of a hammer in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Was his hand over-board? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Then he had only to open his hand, and it must have gone? - A. I clenched his hand; I searched Amos, but found nothing upon him; I examined the lug-boat, in consequence of a boy, in their hearing, telling me he had brought them from that lug-boat; I went to the lug-boat, and found fifteen casks of coffee, marked from one to fifteen, with an hour-glass, and a flag, 
               <persName id="t18030420-72-person629">B.C. </persName>
            the cask No. 9, appeared to have lost a great deal of coffee; the cantling-piece of the head appeared to to have been taken out; the plug of the samplehole was taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. That is usually covered with a hoop? - A. Yes, I found the hoop at the bottom of the boat, it had been wrenched off; there appeared to be a great deficiency in the cask, and I compared the cofee that I found upon the prisoner Ellis with that in the cask, and it appeared to be of the same quality; I then gave the coffee to the mate of the Henrietta, and took the prisoners to the office; I was present when it was weighed, it weighed six hundred, three quarters, and sixteen pounds, tare one hundred and six pounds, marked upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.This lug-boat in which the coffee was, had been in dock, had not she? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. She was a-ground, was not she? - A.No, it is a deep place there.</p>
               <p>Q. I am told, after she was loaded, she had been sent into a dock? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Where you saw the boat, is in the City of London? - A.No, in the precinct of St. Catherine's.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WORTHY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am a waterman, belonging to the Thames-Police; I was with Mr. Cowen on the 24th of February.</p>
               <p>Q.You have heard his evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you agree in the story he has told? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.After these two persons were taken into custody, did you hear either of them say any thing? - A. I heard Amos say d-n it, they can only take 40s. conviction on it!</p>
               <p>Q.You have a great deal of smuggling on the river? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>And if you take any of them it is a 40s. penalty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES DERBY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an apprentice to my father, a waterman; on the 24th of February I was upon the river, in my father's wherry.</p>
               <p>Q.Was you hailed by any person in the Hamburgh tier? - A. Yes, by the two prisoners; they were in a lug-boat; I rowed off to them, and took them into my boat; I asked them where they were going, and they said towards St. Catharine's; I did not see them bring any thing into the boat.</p>
               <p>Q.Before they got into the boat, had you any bag or handkerchief in your boat? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.After you put off, did you see the Police boat? - A. Yes, the Police boat came down as I was shooting in shore; Amos threw over a handkerchief, and Ellis threw over a bag of something.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take Cowen to the same lug-boat, from which you had brought them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES BECKETT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am a lighterman; I do business for Mr. Winholt; I know the prisoner, Ellis, he was in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200086"/>service, and this lug-boat was to have fifteen casks of coffee from the West-India Docks, on the morning of the 22d of February.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you direct Ellis to do any thing with that coffee? - A. I ordered my servant to direct Ellis to put them on board the Henrietta, bound for Hamburgh.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you yourself see fifteen casks? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.How came they to lie in the lug-boat the whole of the 23d? - A.There were other goods before us; sometimes we lay for a week or ten days. - JUDSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a clerk to Mr. Winholt. Q.Did you put these fifteen casks of coffee on board the lug-boat, to be carried to the ship? - A. I entered them at the Custom-house, and gave directions.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Beckett.) Did you see them weighed before they left the West-India Docks? - A.No.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am foreman at the coffee warehouse, at the West-India Docks.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you weigh these casks of coffee? - A. Yes, I weighed them in the month of November.</p>
               <p>Q.What did No. 9 contain? - A.(refers to his book.) Seven hundred weight, one quarter, and twenty-two pounds; the entry is in my own writing, tare one hundred and six pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Have you ever seen the casks of coffee since the time of the coffee being lost? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Anthony Schick, Esq. I am proprietor of the coffee.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Ellis, put in a written defence, stating that he was innocent of the crime laid to his charge.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you keep a house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any partner? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you the last person up on the 21st of March? - A. I was; I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you make fast your doors and windows? - A. Yes, I did: On Tuesday, the 22d, about six o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by a person who lodges in my house; I came down stairs, and found the two parlour-doors open, and the shopdoor, and the property taken out.</p>

               <p>Q.How came those doors open? - A.They were entered by means of some person or persons sealing the wall which has access to the parlourdoor; they broke open the parlour-door, which goes into the yard; they must have got over the wall in the yard, which is about ten feet high.</p>
               <p>Q.How was that door broke? - A. By taking away the grove which supports the shutter; that was knocked away, and the shutter fell down.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there no pin to fasten it? - A.No, I did not think it necessary, as there was such a high wall; it was a glass door, and the glass was broken, by which means they got in; then they had to break open an inner parlour-door, which was locked; I think I took the key of the shop up into the bed-room, but I may be mistaken in that; if I did, they must have gone up into the bed-room, and taken the key off the drawers; the shop-door was broke open by splitting the pannel of the door; I lost about twenty loaves of sugar, and at least twelve hundred weight of moist sugar, forty pounds weight of tea, five silver tea-spoons, one table-spoon, and two shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. The sugar, I suppose, was in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were the spoons? - A. In the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q.And the shirts? - A. In the parlour also.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your lodger here? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Have you more than one lodger? - A. Yes, three.</p>
               <p>Q.None of them are here? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. The key of the shop-door it was your habit to take up with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt that you took it up with you that night? - A. I came down stairs again for the key of my bed-room, which I had forgot, and I might have left the key of the shop-door.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not tell the Magistrate that you did take the key up, and put it by your bed-side? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q.One should think it must be somebody pretty well acquainted with your house that had done this? - A.No, I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you think any stranger might have found it without any difficulty? - A.There might be persons out of the house as well acquainted with it as persons in the house.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to say the two prisoners were acquainted with your house? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not you find that your shop-door had been opened by a key? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200087"/>Q. And that key was left in the lock inside? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this wall is ten feet high? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a very convenient wall for women to scale? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was awoke at six o'clock in the morning, it was light? - A. Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>Q.Should you know the note again if you was to see it? - A. Yes, I put my initials upon it before I parted with it, and it has a spot of grease upon the middle of it.</p>

               <p>Q. To whom were the bundles delivered then? A.One of the officers told Mackay to get out his bundle, and he only took up two bundles; he left the other in his bed; the next day, when the Captain came on board, he ordered me to clean out the cabin; I made Mackay's bed first, and I wondered to see the pillow lay so high at the head; I listed up the pillow, and there I saw a bundle.</p>

Mackay took up the skirts of his coat, and while I was looking at him, a man called to me to steer to such a point of the land, in order to escape the crowd that was upon the Pier; I was at the helm; while I was looking at that, I heard a sharp splash in the water; then I looked very earnestly, but did not see any thing.</p>

               <p>Q.Was there any thing particular about that note by which you should know it again? - A. Yes, there was a small spot of grease upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that note? - A. This is very like it, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the same note? - A.I think that is it; the spot of grease is rather larger.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you tell Mackay what Read had told you? - A.I did.</p>
               <p>Q.What did Mackay say? - A.He said, it was a good one, and the people in London did not know any thing about Scotch notes; that if he was in Scotland, there would he no hesitarion about it.</p>
               <p>Q.At this time do you know whether Mackay had any other notes? - A. Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q.How many? - A. I suppose eighteen or twenty.</p>
               <p>Q.How do you know? - A. I saw them that night in his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say any thing more about these notes? - A.After a great deal of conversation, he shewed me the notes, and told me they were bad ones; I was very much displeased at his imposing upon me to go out and cash these bad notes for him.</p>
               <p>Q.Tell us all that he said about these bad notes? - A.He told me at length that they really were bad ones; that he was going to meet the party in Threadneedle-street on Saturday night, and if I chose to go with him, I should see the person that made them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go with him? - A. I went with him at last to a house called the King's Arms, or the King's Head, in Threadneedle-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he at all explain to you, before you went to the King's Head, what was his errand in London? - A.He told me it was for the purpose of getting some of these notes from Catapodi.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went with him to Threadneedle-street, who did you see there? - A.I was desired by him to go to Foss at his own house, and to say that he and Catapodi would wait for him at the King's Head, in Threadneedle-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you all meet together there? - A. We all met together.</p>
               <p>Q.What passed then? - A.The prisoner, Catapodi, did not seem much to agree to take me into company.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mackay or Foss say any thing to that? - A.They had no objection; Mackay said, he had nothing to fear from me, that I was a friend of his.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they then permit you to stay among them? - A. Yes, they had no objection.</p>
               <p>Q.What passed then? - A.They were talking about the superscriptions of these notes, and about the feal.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any thing produced? - A. I saw there a steel seal produced.</p>
               <p>Q.Who produced it? - A. I suppose it was Catapodi's, but I saw it in the hands of Foss.</p>
               <p>Q.Why did you suppose it was Catapodi's? - A.Because Mackay told me that Catapodi had the whole management of the business.</p>
               <p>Q.Besides the seal, what else did you observe? - A. I saw a small slip of paper, with three impressions of the seal made upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.What was said about these three impressions? - A.Mackay said these three impressions were too slight to have the desired effect upon the notes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did any body make any observation upon that? - A. Yes; Catapodi said he would after it, and recommended that a small piece of lead should be got; that they should put the note upon the lead, and stamp it on the lead, it would then have the desired effect.</p>
               <p>Q.What was said to that? - A. It was agreed upon by the whole party that they should take that method.</p>
               <p>Q.Who took away the seal then? - A.Henry Foss.</p>

               <p>Q. You have talked about notes, did you see any notes at that meeting? - A. I saw Mackay take out his pocket-book, shew some of the notes, and find fault with the superscription.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing else produced? - A.Nothing else at that time.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you, at any time, see any ink produced? - A.There were two phials of ink produced that night; Catapodi produced them, and gave them to Mackay; one was red, and the other black; Catapodi told me the ink he had formerly procured he thought infufficient for the purpose; then he put these two bottles into his hand, and he told him, that whatever quantity he wanted when he was in Scotland, he would send it upon his sending the money.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was to keep this ink? - A.Mackay himself.</p>
               <p>Q.For what purpose? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mackay say whether he should want any or not? - A.He said he should have occasion for more soon.</p>
               <p>Q.More notes, or more ink, or what? - A.More notes.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had parted, and Foss taken away the seal, did you afterwards see Foss? - A. Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200095"/>there was an appointment made the next day; Foss and Mackay were to meet at Foss's house.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you meet? - A.We did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what Mackay did with the notes? - A. Yes, at the meeting, the next day, he gave them to Foss.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know how many, as near as you can guess? - A.Twelve or thirteen.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not count them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what Foss did with them after Mackay had given them to him? - A. No; he ordered Foss to go to some person with these notes.</p>
               <p>Q.For what purpose? - A.For the purpose of stamping them, as I understood from Mackay.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of Foss after this? - A.He went out, and was absent about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he bring back with him? - A.He brought some notes back, stamped, with a seal upon them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go home with Mackay after he had got the notes stamped? - A.I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mackay look at them before you parted? - A.He did.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say any thing about them? - A.Not till he got home to the Blue Boar; he said they were very well done.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he do with them? - A.He put them into his pocket-book; but upon putting them in, he found that three were not stamped.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you sleep together that night? - A. Yes; next morning he told me to take these notes to Foss, and desire him to get them done like the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you left the house, did you see Mackay do any thing? - A. I saw him on the Sunday; he got up a little before me, and came to a small table, and took out four notes, and I saw him write upon three notes from a fourth, which he had by him.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the writing part? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon after that was it that you left the house? - A.On Monday morning; I went with the three unstamped notes to Foss.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find Foss? - A.No, I found him on Tuesday morning; I delivered him three unstamped notes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what he did with them? - A.He ordered me to wait till he returned; after he had been gone about half an hour, or twenty minutes, he returned with a bit of lead in one pocket, and a feal in the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see what he did with the lead and the seal? - A. Yes; he put the lead upon the ground, put the notes one by one upon the lead, then he put the seal upon them, and knocked it with a hammer, which produced the impression very clearly.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do with them? - A. I returned to Mackay, and found he was gone on board a ship; I wished to go with him, as he promised to pay my passage.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you follow him on board the ship? - A.I did.</p>
               <p>Q.What ship was it? - A.The Osnaburgh packet.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find the ship at the wharf? - A. No, she had left the wharf; I took a boat, and overtook her; I found Mackay on board.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you deliver any thing to Mackay when you got on board? - A. Yes, the three notes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know of any bundles? - A. Yes, he had a bundle, and I had a small bundle myself.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you keep any of those notes in your bundle? - A.No, I never had any.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time you delivered the notes to Mackay, was all the printed part done? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you got on board the packet, you went to Dundee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You were both apprehended at Dundee? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you taken from the ship directly on shore, or from some distance? - A. We were taken at a distance from shore in the river.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect any thing happening before you got on shore? - A. I saw Mackay take out his pocket-book, and slip it over the edge of the boat.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you know what pocket-book he had at that time? - A.I think it was a red Turkey one; I never saw him with more than one.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it such a one as this? - A. Yes, I believe that is the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q.And that you saw him slip over-board? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You were taken into custody, brought up to London, and then you gave your information? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.You had no notion at all of these notes being forged? - A.Not till I was detected offering a bad note to be oashed to Read.</p>
               <p>A.You had no suspicion at all till then? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.You were a very honest man, had fallen into bad hands, and had not the least notion that any of these notes were forged? - A.I had not.</p>
               <p>Q.I dare say you can read and write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Before that, according to your own account, you had heard some conversation about stamps? - A. No, I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q.You have given some account to day of a conversation about stamps before you went to Read? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you think London was the place in which the British Linen Company manufactured their notes? - A.No, I had no reason to think so.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you thought the notes genuine at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.If you had not thought they were genuine,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200096"/>you would not have done any thing whatever respecting them? - A. No, I should have had no part in it whatever.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went, according to your own account, to Foss to get them stamped, you thought they were genuine notes? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.You said you would not have had any thing to do with them if you had known it - why did not you leave their company directly? - A.Because I could not get home; it was merely for the purpose of getting home to Scotland.</p>
               <p>Q.You went to Foss, and saw him stamp them, and you did all this merely to get home to Scotland, and that you expect to be believed? - A. I hope so.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever seen any of these notes in Scotland? - A.But very few of the five-pound ones.</p>
               <p>Q.As five-pound notes were searce in Scotland, you was surprised there were so many in London? - A.There were but eighteen.</p>
               <p>Q.This inflexible honesty, that was not to be overcome but by the hope of a voyage home, of course led you to give information to the Magistrate? - A.No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it you first gave information about this business? - A.At Dundee.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps at that time you were in custody? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q.You know you were in custody respecting forged notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And then you rather chose to give evidence against somebody else, than that any body should give evidence against you? - A. I did not mind who gave evidence against me.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you no fears about it for yourself? - A. No, only for fear of being disrgraced.</p>
               <p>Q.But no fear of being punished? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you gave evidence upon patriotic principles, to punish guilty men - purely for the sake of public justice? - A. I think it is very proper.</p>
               <p>Q.And you did it merely because it was proper, and not for your own safety? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Q.What opportunity had you of seeing the prisoner? - A. I knew his voice by his speaking when he got into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of night was it? - A. A moonlight night, the moon had been up some time.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect him by his features? - A. I knew him nearly four years; I have no doubt about his person, he was a private soldier in the artillery, at Woolwhich, and he and I were fellowprisoners together in the King's-bench, nine months, when he lived with a Mr. Bentley, in prison.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you talk to him as if you had known him? - A.No, or he to me, I don't think he had any knowledge of me, I saw him the Monday fortnight following, at Bow-street, when I swore to him.</p>
               <p> - EASTWOOD Sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street, and met the prisoner in the King's private road, this side of Sloane-square, on the 20th of March, about a quarter past ten, at night; I stopped him on suspicion, and found on his person a pistol, loaded with broken glass and powder; he would not give any account of himself.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SAMPSON Sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a watchman; I was employed upon Williams's wharf, it is next to Anderson's wharf.</p>
               <p>Q.On the night of the 3d of March last, were you upon Williams's wharf? - A. Yes, I was; it was a moon-light night; I saw two men take a skiff from Anderson's wharf; they were of different sizes, one was a good deal shorter than the other; I took them to be two big lads; it was about seven o'clock in the evening; they unloosed the skiff from her moorings, and carried her off.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you give any information to Anderson's servants, and how soon afterwards? - A. It might be twenty minutes; a servant enquired whether I saw any thing of the skiff being carried away, and I told him.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the two prisoners at the bar, and tell me whether you have any knowledge of their persons who took away the skiff? - A. I cannot say; by size they appear to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q.You are the watchman at Williams's wharf? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How far is that distant from Anderson's? - A. There is a brick wall between them; not more than two yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever seen this skiff before? - A.I never had, to my knowledge, she was a new skiff.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you saw the skiff put off, had you observed her at all? - A. No, I had taken no notice of her.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether she was moored or not, you know nothing about? - A. I know she was moored, by seeing them cast her off; I saw them undo her, and push her off, and take her away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.You say it was a skiff that was taken- you don't know who it was taken by? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know whether there were any sculls in the boat? - A. Yes, there were sculls, but they were fastened to it.</p>

             and Jannet Johnstone.</p>
               <p>Q.Are the same persons who are proprietors of the wharf proprietors of the skiff? - A. Yes; the last time I saw the skiff was about eleven o'clock in the morning on the 3d of March.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you see her? - A. On the premises of Mrs. Andersons wharf; it is called Anderson's coal wharf; I moored her myself both head and stern.</p>
               <p>Q.Is that in the City of London? - A. Yes; I missed her between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and I made enquiry of the last witness, Mr. Sampson; there were a pair of sculls in her, secured by an iron bolt, and that bolt fastened by a chain; I went in pursuit of the skiff, in consequence of the information I had received, and in about an hour after I discovered her going by Queenhithe; she was coming from Blackfriars-bridge towards London-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that in a direction from Anderson's wharf? - A. Yes; I pursued her, and caught them on the Surrey side of the water; I found the two prisoners at the bar on board.</p>
               <p>Q.Any other persons? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find the two sculls on board? - A. I did; the two prisoners had each of them one in their hands; it appeared to me that the eye of the bolt had been cut, or forced off, by that means the lock got off; I brought them to the wharf where the boat had been taken from, and a patrol was sent for to take charge of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q.When you saw them, they were rowing on the North side? - A. The tide was running up.</p>
               <p>Q.How would that have been for making their way to Horsham stairs? - A. It was almost in a direct line; the tide would not have answered completely to have fetched her there.</p>
               <p>Q.Would that have been a course much out of the way? - A.They were rowing against the tide.</p>
               <p>Q.How far were they got over the Thames when you overtook them? - A.The nearest landing-place was at Bank-end.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were they rowing in a direction to Bank-end? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How is the skiff constructed? - A.She is made in the same form as other boats are; what we call lightermen's skiffs.</p>
               <p>Q.She is a boat that was used at Anderson's wharf? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time you saw this skiff, what had she on board? - A. I found a bed there, and a large bag, but what the contents were I did not look.</p>
               <p>Q.What time did you first come to the wharf after that? - A. I think it wanted about twenty minutes of eight.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Do you know who this bed and bag belonged to? - A.No, not of my own knowledge; they did not belong to any body at the wharf.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.Did the persons in the skiff do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200100"/>all they could to get away from you? - A.Apparently they did.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. This young lad and I happened to meet together in the City, and we went down to the water-side with intent to go by water, and there was nothing but this skiff, and a man was standing by her, and he said he would give us a cast over; he said, if we would row over, he would meet us on the other side.</p>
               <p>Williams's defence. I have nothing further to say than the other young man has said.</p>

               <p>Q. I want to know the reason why; it might have been delivered, and paid for afterwards? - A.Because Mrs. King was busy at the time.</p>

             sworn. - I am a soldier belonging to the Coldstream regiment; I was drinking a pot of beer at Mr. King's, in Brewer-street, Golden-square, about one o'clock, when the prisoner came in, and went out again; about two minutes after the prisoner came back; he called for a pint of porter; he took the box to himself where this parcel laid, fronting the bar-door; he changed sixpence, and asked Mrs. King for his change; he then went out, and this gentleman got up, and asked Mrs. King whether she had seen his parcel.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was Mrs. King about all this time? - A.She was in the bar, and walking about the tap-room about her business; she did not seem to be busy about any thing in particular, only serving the Jew with a pint of porter; there were about five people in company.</p>
               <p>Q. There was not a throng of business just at the moment? - A. No, there was not; they draw the beer in the bar; as soon as the prisoner was gone, the prosecutor asked Mrs. King whether she had the parcel, and she said, no; he said he was certain that the Jew must have got it; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200104"/>went out, and brought the prisoner back; that is all I saw of it; he said, I will give you any thing to make it up, for consider my wife and family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The poor fellow had a feeling for his wife and family, and begged the prosecutor to have mercy on him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know a little what we mean by skylarking? - A. Yes, some soldiers are fond of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many soldiers were in the room? - A. There was only one, of the name of Dawson; the prisoner went out at first, and then came in again, and called for his beer; he was out about two minutes; his bag was full of clothes; I saw him come in with his bag.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner went out the first time, did neither of you, or Dawson, say, it would be a good thing to skylark the Jew? - A. No, never was a word of the kind spoken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see a hat produced? - A. He never shewed a hat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you remember the man coming in with the tobacco? - A. He was in before I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a box between him and his tobacco? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by skylarking? - A. Sometimes persons play the rogue with each other, making a derision, or joke of a man.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hutchinson.) I should like to look at your permit; you say this happened on Tuesday the 5th of March, and I see this permit bears date the 4th, and was to be in use only one hour - how came you not to go on the 4th? - A.Because I had not an opportunity.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to deceive me, and say it was all right, when the permit was nothing but waste paper? - A.Because I had not an opportunity to take it before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been in this country for forty years, and I never wronged any body of a piece of paper.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 6, in George-street, Portland Chapel; the prisoner, Cook, took my lodging, a two-pair-of-stars front room, about a year and a half ago, to the best of my recollection, and he has continued to lodge with me till he was taken up. I am a carman; he asked for liberty to box a wheel, or a pair of wheels, which he had done several times whilst he worked at Mr. Thompson's, in Mortimer-street, which he used to do in his dinner hours, and at night when he had done work; these were small wheels for trucks; I don't know who brought the wheels that were found in my yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. He used to do these odd jobs at dinner time? - A. Yes.(One of the wheels produced.)</p>
               <p>Jagues. This is one of the wheels we lost; you will find it a lead colour underneath, if you scrape a little of the paint off; I have had it in my hands a hundred times.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman, at St. Giles's; it was between twelve and one o'clock when I was called; this gentleman called watchman, and I came immediately up to him, he shewed his pocket, and the place where the money was dropped, and I picked up half-a-guinea, and two six-pences; he shewed me the alley the woman was gone into; he told me that a person went into that house; there was an old woman, and I asked him, if that was the person that he wanted; no, says he; we went up stairs, and he said that was the person, and gave charge of her; she was in bed; I found two shillings and five-pence half-penny upon her.</p>
               <p>JAMES PARRY sworn. - I am a patrol, belonging to St. Giles's parish; I was standing at the watch-box, at the time the prosecutor was crying out watchman, I am robbed, I am robbed! he said he had been robbed by one sat woman; he said that she went down this passage.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prosecutor charge any body else besides this woman? - A. No, he did not; this woman had a light in her apartment, and the moment we knocked at the door to get in, the light went out immediately; the house is inhabited by unfortunate women.</p>

            , the warehouse is under Mr. Lobban's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe to us what kind of floor there is to the warehouse? - A. It is an old floor, it is wood; the prisoner has been eleven years warehouseman with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How is this warehouse situated with respect to the street? - A.There is a court-yard; Mr. Lobban's house stands in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the entrance into this yard? - A. Through a pair of great gates, or otherwise a hatch, which a coach can drive in.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the warehouse generally secured? - A. There are shutters, and a lock to the door, and a staple over the lock, to which a padlock is affixed; the padlock was put on in the evening, when the warehouse was done with.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose possession were the keys of the lock of the door kept? - A. The prisoner had a key, and I had a key, and no body else.</p>
               <p>Q. Who generally kept the key of the padlock? - A. No body but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me who had the possession on the 20th of February last? - A.The prisoner; it was on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the key of the padlock upon that occasion? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q.Relate to his Lordship and the Jury if any thing passed upon the 20th of February respecting this warehouse? - A. As near as I can guess, sometime after seven in the evening, there came a knock at the door very violent; the servant called me out; I immediately went to the warehouse on hearing it was on fire; I found a crowd in the yard, the padlock was knocked off, and the door bursted open; the warehouse was full of smoke, and the cask, which had been on fire, rolled out into the yard to be extinguished, which saved the warehouse; it was a whole cask, with the head out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in the cask? - A. It was full of ashes, or something, I presume shavings; indeed I will say there were shavings that were left.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you been last there? - A. To the best of my recollection not since the Thursday evening myself.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you observed any cask in your warehouse of that description? - A. There certainly was a cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any carpenters' there? - A.There had been a door mended on the opposite side of the yard; that door belonged to me, it was an outward door; it might be a week or twelve days before this conslagration.</p>
               <p>Q.The prisoner came to the warehouse that evening? - A. Yes, nearly as I can recollect, about half an hour after I got there; when the man came into the yard there was a general buzz; here comes the warehouseman; I said, say nothing, let him come in; I let him come into the warehouse, and asked him rather sharply what business he had there that afternoon, his answer was, I came to feed the cat; I said you must give a better account of this business before we part; he turned round as if to go away; upon which I observed, as that is the case, Sir, I shall cut the matter short; I asked whether there was a constable present; there was one, whom I delivered him to, to take to the Compter immediately, and bring him before the Lord Mayor the next morning, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the key which you had in your possession? - A. It always hung before my desk in the accompting-house; I took the key with me in consequence of the alarm of fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner at any time after this, which did not occur before the Lord Mayor? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you made him any offers of favour? - A. I am positive I did not; I went to him about a fortnight after this business, for in taking the stock I missed a considerable quantity of goods in this warehouse, and asked him what had become of these goods; he at first denied knowing any thing about them; I told him that he must know what was become of them; I made use of this observation to him - I have often suspected people that may be innocent; the warehouse was broke open twice two years running, you have now heaped guilt enough upon your head, and may as well tell the truth, and I shall no longer suspect innocent people; says he, Sir, I will tell you to morrow; I said you may as well tell me now, upon which he walked up and down the room two or three times agitated, and said, I took them, and sold them to such and such people, naming the people.</p>
               <p>Q.Where are those people now? - A. I took them up before a Magistrate, and they are now upon bail.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you have the goodness to tell us in what state the windows are in at your warehouse? - A.The windows which have no shutters are, certainly broke a good deal, but there is a very thick iron grating before the windows; they are not wide enough to admit of a child; they are about six inches apart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. - Q. The prisoner lived eleven years with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And had a favourite cat in the warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of the property you have missed? - A. As near as I could calculate between two and three hundred pounds, at least.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Lobban; I have lived in his service near a quarter of a year; I was there at the time of the fire; he lives in Great Winchester-street, No. 28; I know the prisoner at the bar; I don't know in whose employ he was; I saw him on the day the fire happened, at Mr. Lobban's, in Winchester-street, as near as I can guess between four and five in the afternoon; he rung at the bell and I let him in; I did not let any other person in with him; he went to Mr. Geledneki's warehouse; I don't know where he went in; I saw him take the lock in his hand, and that was all I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had gone into the house, how long was it before the fire happened? - A. As near as I can guess seven o'clock, it might be ten minutes after; I went to the finishing shop to get some coals, it is across the yard, and as I came out I saw Mr. Geledneke's warehouse on fire; I immediately set my coal-scuttle down, and gave the alarm to my mistress that the premises were on fire, and then I ran to the gate and gave the same alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long the prisoner staid there after you admitted him into the yard? - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let him out? - A. He went across the yard, and I went to see if the gate was shut, and it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Could any one come into the yard when the gate was shut, unless it was opened on the inside? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had let the prisoner out, and before you discovered the fire, had you admitted any other person into the yard? - A. Yes, an acquaintance of my fellow-servant's.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner went out, how long was it before your fellow-servant's acquaintance came in? - A. As near as I can guess about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where did your fellow-servant's acquaintance go to? - A. He came across the yard into Mr. Lobban's kitchen; he continued in the house about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he the whole of the ten minutes in the house? - A. Yes, talking to my fellow-servant; I let him out again; I went with him to the gate; he went directly out without stopping in the yard; I shut the gate after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let in any other person before the fire happened? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person go out of the house into the street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gate continue shut until you gave the alarm of fire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave the alarm of fire, was the warehouse door shut or open? - A.Shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any one come into the yard upon your giving the alarm? - A. No, not till I opened the gate to let them come into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any one open the warehouse door after the people were admitted into the yard? - A. I opened the gate, and a great many people came in, and a gentleman broke the door open with a poker; I have seen the gentleman here to day, this is the gentleman, Mr. Jepson.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Mr. Boldero, the banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Winchester-street, at Mr. Lobban's house, at the time of the alarm of fire being given? - A. I was not there at the time the alarm was given, but I was there between the hours of seven and eight o'clock at night, I cannot exactly speak to the time; when I got into Mr. Lobban's yard, there were three females.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to get into Mr. Lobban's yard? - A. The first thing that I heard was the screaming of female voices; I was in my way home; I turned round, and a man came running down the street crying fire; I went into Mr. Lobban's yard, the gate was open, and first I observed three ladies standing there; I asked them where the fire was; I observed the fire through the window of a warehouse, which I understood to belong to Mr. Geledneki; I asked the ladies if they had got the key of the warehouse; they said, no; I asked them if they had a crow, or any thing I could force the door with; they then brought me a poker; I observed there was a lock and a padlock; I resorted to the poker, and broke the hanging lock off; the other lock was not locked; as soon as ever the padlock was off, I took the catch off, and got in.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the appearance of the warehouse at the time? - A.Directly opposite the door there was a large cask, or hogshead, which was on fire, and blazed nearly to the roof of the premises; the head of the cask was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the flames force their way through the hoops of the cask? - A. They came through the staves, and came right up as well as out of the head of the cask; we called immediately for water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any part of the warehouse having been burnt? - A. We did not go so nigh; we called for water, and we succeeded in a few minutes in putting out the fire; after the fire had been extinguished, I desired first of all that the cask might not be brought into the warehouse, for fear there might be any fire in it; in turning the cask upside down, a quantity of burnt shavings appeared to fall out of it, with a piece of the cask, or some other matter, which appeared nearly consumed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then return to the warehouse? - A. I did; I first looked into the shavings to see if I could find any thing by which I could suppose it had been set on fire, and there was a flat piece of board, near the place where the cask was, which appeared to be a lid of a box; it was scorched a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200110"/>little; very near the mouth of the cask, there was a box to which that flat piece of board seemed to be the lid of; there was likewise a large cask, which stood by the side, which appeared to be very much scorched, and which I have no doubt would very soon have been on fire; I was very much afraid that the fire had got into the cask, as smoke appeared to be issuing from it, and therefore I imagined there was fire inside of it; I wished it to be opened, and it was opened by Mr. Geledneki's desire; it was filled with furs; it appeared this cask was not on fire; I observed three or four other casks standing round, but they were not scorched.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Clifford. Q. You are fireman to the London Insurance Company? - A. Yes, about sixteen years, and foreman about five.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being called upon on Sunday, the 20th of February, to any place? - A. Yes, I was called to Chigwell; I was coming by Great Winchester-street, and stopped my engine there; I heard a piece of work, and people run after me to stop my engine; I went to Winchester-street, to Mr. Geledneki's warehouse, the fire was out; I went into the warehouse, and made an enquiry about the fire, how it might happen; I went to inspect into it, and I saw a quantity of shavings lay close by the door, part burnt and part unburnt; I examined the flooring, and found it was burnt; I examined the cask, and I saw part of it was burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Having been a fireman for sixteen years, you can tell us whether that appearance of fire was of long standing, or whether it immediately happened? - A. It could not have been, to the best of my judgment, more than two or three hours burning.(Mr. Alley then addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.(To Mr. Geledneki.) Was there any body, besides the prisoner, that went into the warehouse between the Thursday and the Sunday, and was that at candle-light or day-light? - A.Not any body but the prisoner only, by day-light, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, after you had made this discovery about the stable-door, did you go into the rickyard? - A. I went straight into the rick-yard, and I had my lantern in my hand, I saw a man lay under a stack of wood; he was stooping down, apparently to conceal himself; I endeavoured to lay hold of him; immediately he saw me he ran away, and jumped over the paling; I had no opportunity of observing his face, only his back; he was not very tall, he was a middling size man; he did work for Mr. Willian at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the stack of wood, under which the man was standing, from the stable-door which had been broke open? - A. About one hundred and fifty yards, as near as I can guess; I followed the man, and tried to catch him, but could not; I came back, and I found the tub with about half of the horse-shoes gone out of it, and likewise a sack, with three pair of horse-shoes in it, under the stack of wood; I found a pitchfork by the side of the tub, with the times bent three or four ways; they were bent in breaking open the door, to my belief.</p>
               <p>Q.You mean the prongs, don't you? - A. Yes; I informed Mr. Clark about ten minutes after; the horse-shoes are here.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am foreman to Mr. Willan; from the information of the last witness, I went immediately to the lodging of the prisoner, at the Coach and Horses, in Graston-court; I took the sack down with me; it is about three quarters of a mile; it is kept by a person of the name of Backston.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mr. Backston give you any shoe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up into the prisoner's room to take him? - A. Not till the next morning; the landlord gave me the shoe the over night; I reckon I got in about twenty minutes after he had got in; he was sitting in the tap-room of Mr. Backston's house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long might that be after the robbery? - A. It might be about twenty minutes, or half an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Was that a left shoe, or a right shoe? - A. A left shoe (a man's shoe produced) this is a left shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean a shoe that has apparently been worn upon the left foot? - A. Yes; I had seen the stable-door as late as five o'clock that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time where were the horse-shoes that were found by Tuck under the stack of wood? - A. The inside of the door of the stable there was above 200 weight in the tub, it was nailed down, and the stable-door was locked; the pitch-fork was laying close by the tub, it was in the cow-shed about four o'clock in the afternoon; the cow-shed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200111"/>is close to the stable, the prisoner had worked in the cow-shed. (The horse-shoes and pitchfork produced.)</p>

               <p>Q. Is the pitch-fork Mr. Willan's property? - A. His mark is there, T. W.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the horse-shoes Mr. Willan's property? - A. I don't know; the horse-shoes that were in the tub were Mr. Willan's property.</p>
               <p>Q.Did they match exactly? - A. I think verily they be the same; the tub had been broke open, and horse-shoes taken out.</p>

On giving him the key and candle, seeing him agitated, and out of breath, I had the curiosity to look over the bar-door, and I saw he had but one shoe on; I watched the man to the landing-place of the stairs, and saw him pull off the left-foot shoe, and put it behind the shutters; he went up stairs, and put on the shoes which he had in my bar; when he was gone up stairs, I took the shoe, and locked it up in my parlour cupboard, and when Mr. Clark came, I shewed it to him; I kept the shoe that night, but the next morning I gave it to Mr. Clark.</p>

               <p>Court. After it had run out, what did they do with the cask that stood on the ground? - A. They listed it up, and put it on the dray.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they fill it? - A. They were a long while about it, because it frothed so much, they laid it on the dray, and brought it round the corner going towards Great Queen-street.</p>
               <p>DANIEL EDWARDS sworn. - My father is a brewer, in Holborn; Mr. Underwood pointed out the dray, and I followed it from Lincoln's-inn-fields to St. Martin's work-house, by Hemming's-row; I observed who was with the dray, King was one of them; I saw them lay down the ten barrels of beer which they had in the dray into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200116"/>St. Martin's work-house, and laid this cask, which they had filled out of the ten barrels, on the pulley which was behind, it is a ladder; they went back to Mr. Sellon's house, and on returning home, they left it at a little house on Back-hill; I cannot tell whose house; they went home and loaded again five hogsheads, and when they came out they called for the cask which they had left on Back-hill; it was an eighteen gallon cask, they took it down to the Westminster Infirmary, where they laid the five hogsheads down, then they went from there to Chiswell-street, the Coach and Horses, and they laid down this eighteen gallon cask which they had drawn off at the Coach and Horses.</p>

             sworn. - I am an Inspector for the Committee of Brewers, to inspect into the casks; I took a warrant to Mr. Tunbridge, and told him there was a warrant against him for an eighteen gallon cask of beer, we told him it was of no use to deny it, we knew it was on the premises, and when we told him so, he immediately shewed us the cask; it was in a back kitchen, under the bench, and while I was looking at this cask one of the people went into the back yard, and looked there, and there was an empty cask belonging to Mr. Sellon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this cask in the back kitchen full or empty. - A. Full, the other in the yard was empty; I have got the marks of the brewers in my possession, and I can swear to their property; I can swear to Mr. Sellon's mark, it is W.S. and on the eighteen gallon cask there is his name in full.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Casks get into various hands? - A. They get to various public-houses in the course of trade.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether they are the customers of Mr. Sellon, or not? - A. Yes, they do by accident.</p>
               <p>Q. He shewed you this cask, which you had been describing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you likewise he was not at home when it was brought? - A. I recollect him saying that the men had brought him a cask.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no difficulty in shewing you this cask? - A. Not the least; he said that he was so busy, if they had one to leave it, and call to-morrow; to the best of my recollection those were his words.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Sellon allowed so much for the drainings of the casks? - A. I believe not, none at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You know Mr. Nares, the Magistrate? - A. Yes; I took him to the Office, in Hatton-garden; Mr. Bleamire was there; the prisoner was not committed at first; he was permitted by Mr. Nares to go away, and appear again.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the first time you took him to Hatton-street? - A. I believe it was about three o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see the mill? - A. On the 13th of March, on Sunday, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I had eleven sacks of wheat in my mill then; I locked the mill-door after me, at four o'clock in the afternoon, and went home; I did not return to the mill till Tuesday morning, ten o'clock; I found the mill-door open, and seven sacks of wheat were missing out of eleven; apparently no violence had been used to the lock; seemingly it must have been opened by some key, or picklock of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did the prisoner live? - A. He lived in Silver-street, Edmonton, to the best of my knowledge, near a quarter of a mile from the mill; the prisoner is a corn-chandler; he was acquainted with the mill; I let the mill to him myself; he quitted it at Christmas last; he had a cart at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of cart? - A. It was a yellow cart and narrow wheels, and two side ladders standing up on the sides; a very particular cart.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you first any information respecting this? - A. It gave me suspicion seeing the door opened not by forcible appearance; it struck me that somebody must have gone in that knew the mill.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon had you any information respecting it? - A. It was on the Friday evening following, and I think the Wednesday in the next week I got a search warrant; I found nothing but the cart; I sold him the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he appear before the Justice? - A. On the Saturday following, in the same week.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you before the justice when he was examined? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what he said taken in writing? - A. Yes, it was; Mr. Morris, the Justice, wrote it down; the prisoner signed it; I saw him sign it with a cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this it which you saw the Magistrate write, and the prisoner put his mark to? - (Shews him the paper.) - A. Yes, it is, and signed by the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This cannot be received as evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had had a dispute about the mill? - A. Yes, we had some difference.</p>
               <p>Q. He brought an action against you? - A. No, he did not; I brought an action against him; I never have found my corn since.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know of the house being searched yourself? - A. I heard of it, but I did not see it, I was not there.</p>

               <p>Q. On the Saturday was he permitted to go home from the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not go to make the search till the Wednesday week? - A. No.</p>

A little before eight o'clock in the same evening, he returned, and gave me some information; I took him up to the Public Office, Bow-street, and gave what information I could to the officers; I asked him to go with me, he did not require any compulsion, because I did not tell him where I was going; the rest of the information the officers can tell you better than I can. That same evening there were seven pair of the same shoes found; I saw them taken from the prisoners, part of them, I believe two or three pair were taken from the prisoners, and one pair taken off their feet, it was Gent. I saw the others at the Brown Bear, where the prisoners were locked up; I saw one pair taken from Owen, that is all that I recollect at present.</p>

             sworn. - On the 24th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was walking on the deck of the Sincerity; the prisoner came to me, and asked me if I knew where the mate of the Ruse was; I told him, no, I did not know where he was, but I believed he was gone on shore; he said that he belonged to the Ruse, that he was obliged to sleep on shore the night before, on account of the master and mate having taken the key out of the batch, and he could not get below; he said, he was then come for his dirty linen to get them washed, but he could not get below, because the captain and mate were gone on shore; he asked me if I had a key that I could lend him; I told him, no; he said, if he had a hammer, he would break the lock; I made him no answer to that; at the time he was talking to me, a man on board the Ruse called out, and told him, he had found the key of the batch; he immediately left me, and went on board the Ruse; the vessels were both along-side the wharf, but they lay so near together, that they could get from one to the other; a few minutes after, Birch came down upon the wharf; I told him, a young man that belonged to his vessel had been inquiring for him; he told me there was nobody belonging to the vessel but himself and the master, and he asked me if it was the master; I told him it was not; he saw somebody on board the vessel, and he called to them, and asked them what they did there; the answer they made him, what was it to him; he said, yes, it was to him; I saw a boat go away from the Ruse directly; whether there was one man or two in it I cannot say; Birch immediately came over our vessel, and went on board his own, and he saw the prisoner at the bar on the deck of the Ruse, and he called me to come and assist him; I came to his assistance, and held the prisoner while he went below; he went below, and said, he had missed all these clothes; he took the prisoner away. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. About half past five o'clock, when I came from on board the Neptune, this gentleman apprehended me by the collar.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Look at that duplicate? - A. It is one of the duplicates; it is dated the 26th of March, 1803; the breeches were pawned about eight or nine o'clock in the evening; they have been in our custody ever since.(The breeches produced.)</p>

This conversation brought out Mr. Debatt; he told him, he recollected his being there two or three days prior to that, when he had tendered three bad shillings one after the other; he desired Mr. Debatt not to send for an officer, but he told him he would.

             sworn. - I am a pastrycook, at the Mansion-house: On the 12th of April I was at tea; I heard an altercation, and came into the shop; I recollected the prisoner's person immediately; I told him, I was surprised he should come again, after the remonstrance I made with him last time; I do not recollect what his reply was. I received a shilling from Mrs. Debatt; I sent for an officer; I do not recollect whether I gave the shilling to the officer or to the prisoner; I saw him searched; in one pocket were found two sixpences, one shilling, and some halfpence, all good; and in the other pocket two half crowns and eight shillings, all bad apparently; he was then taken to the Compter.(Edward Alderman, a constable, produced the money.)(Mrs. Debatt identified the shilling she received from the prisoner.)(Mr. William Parker proved the shilling to be a bad one; as also the two half crowns and the eight shillings found upon the prisoner.)</p>

               <p>Q. Who was that person? - A. Ann Williams, the person who has just left the bar; the next day the prisoner came again, and purchased a gown, five yards at two shillings; she would not have any other, because it was not exactly ten shillings; she said she could not pay the whole, but would call in the morning and pay the rest; she then paid me three shillings first, and then one shilling; I put the four shillings in the till; then, after hesitating a little, she asked me what remained to be paid; I told her six shillings; she said, dear me, I believe I may have as much, and produced six shillings, which immediately excited in me a suspicion; she put them all down at once upon a piece of print; I then looked at the shillings very minutely, and found them all very bad; I then charged her with knowing perfectly well that they were bad, from the peculiar manner of offering them in part; I told her I had seen her before; she said, she had never been there before in her life; she said, she wondered at my impudence in charging her, and said she would make me pay for it if I sent for a constable; I had threatened to send for a constable; I sent for David Hughes; she still said she was not guilty, but when a coach came to the door to take her off, she begged pardon, offered to leave all the money, or do any thing rather than go to prison; I kept the six shillings in my own possession, and have had them ever since;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200122"/>I kept them separate from any other money.

Upon taking up the half guinea, I saw it was a bad one. and shewed it my son, and desired him and the patrol to go after the prisoners; they did so, and brought them back; I told them they had passed a bad half guinea; they said, if I would not take them to the watch-house, they would give any thing; they were then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What sort of half guinea was given to you first? - A. A straight one.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the men been gone out of the house before they were brought back? - A. Not a minute.</p>
               <p>JAMES MAYPOWDER sworn - (Confirmed Mrs. Maypowder in her testimony.) I was present at the watch-house, and saw them searched; the prisoner had two good seven-shilling pieces in his pocket; the other man had fifteen shilling in silver, and about tenpenny-worth of halfpence; they let the other man go. When I first went up to the prisoner, he wanted to resist; I shook him, and he put his hand in his pocket, pulled out the half guinea, and let it fall; I called the watchman, who brought a light, and the patrol found it; it appeared to be the half guinea first paid to my mother.</p>
