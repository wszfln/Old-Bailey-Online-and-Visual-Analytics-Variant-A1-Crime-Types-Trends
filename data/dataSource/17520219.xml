               <p>Robert Bugg. On the 18th of December, I went to a public house in <placeName id="t17520219-2-crimeloc8">Drury-Lane</placeName>

                        targets="t17520219-2-off6 t17520219-2-crimeloc8"/>, near my own house; as I returned back, between 8 and 9 at night, the prisoner Hays came before me, and clapped a short sword, or hanger, to my belly, and said, Your watch and money, for I'll run you through the body, in as desperate a manner as he could express himself; he repeated the words again in a moment; Broughton clapped a horse pistol to my breast, with the muzzle under my chin, and said, Don't make a noise, or stir, for if you do, I'll blow your brains out, in as desperate manner as the other, Hays took out of my pocket 6 or 7 shillings, a penknife, some half-pence, and other little using things ; then he examined my pocket again, found no more; it was just before my own door, within 10 yards of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you light enough to see them ?</p>
               <p>Bugg. There was a light directly opposite to my shop; it was not very moonlight; there were lights in other shops, and a lamp at my door; I saw them both as perfect as I do now; I can particularly swear to them both; after they had done, Broughton said, Don't look after us, turn your head another way, for if you do, I'll blow your brains out, so I turned about towards Long-Acre till they were got about three or four rods; then I went into my shop and told my wife, and shut the shop up, and in about a quarter of an hour came the watchman; I said to him, I wished he had come sooner, I had just been robbed, and related the particulars, and how they were dressed, and their size, I could swear to them; they were both in blue-grey, one a tall fellow, the other a short think fellow, with a horseman's coat and boots on, and a whip in one hand, with the thong twisted round it. He said, let us go and search two or three houses here<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190003"/> abouts of ill same. We went, and, in Newtoner's-Lane, by Drury-lane, we saw the two prisoners standing, as though they were in conversation, against a wall; after we had passed them, I pulled the watchman by the coat, and said softly to him, they are the men; then the prisoners went into Drury-lane towards the Cole-yard; we followed them at a distance, thinking they might go into a house; at the upper-end they stopped again, and we went up after them ; they turned into the Cole-yard, and there we lost them; then I said to the watchman, let us get more help; I had told him before they were armed; then the watchman went and got a constable, while I staid in Drury-lane; then we went and searched a house or two; the watchman had me to the Crown and Scepter alehouse, to a man that knew some of these people; the landlord said, after we described them, that they had been at his house drinking ; he also told to their names, and said, he knew them well; he went and loaded a pistol; then there was a cry of stop thief, and in less than half an hour the prisoners were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you was robbed that you went in pursuit of them?</p>
               <p>Bugg. In about half an hour's time; I saw them before the Justice, and they appeared in the same cloaths they had on when they robbed me, only their hats and wigs were off; the arms and whip were dropped in the street, and produced there by some of the people; I did not see them searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your penknife again?</p>
               <p>Bugg. No, my Lord, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. from Broughton. What did he know my face by, had I any particular mark?</p>
               <p>Bugg. When he was before the Justice, he had a mark of a flambeaux on his face, but when he robbed me, his face appeared as it does now.</p>
               <p>Q. from Hayes. Were we in a place of shelter, or in the public street, when you say you passed us?</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is in Long-Acre and part of Drury-Lane; about 9 o'clock at night, on the 18th of December, I was calling the hour in Drury-Lane by his house, he said to me, he had just been robbed, and that he should know the men could he see them, and described them and their dress, one a tall man, the other a thick man, both in blue-grey; the shortest had on a horseman's coat, buckskin breeches, and boots, with a whip in his hand; he was fearful to go after them at first, saying, they were armed; when I had called my round, then he put on his hat (he having none on when he was robbed) to disguise himself, and we went together, and, in Newtoner's-lane, there the two prisoners stood as if they were making water; he pulled me by the sleeve, and said, they are the two men, &amp;c. they answered the description given before; I saw the boots and horsewhip; then they went into Drury-Lane, and pushed on apace; Mr. Bugg being fat, could not walk fast enough, so I went on before him, the two prisoners opened, and I passed between them ; when I was got some little way before them, I blew out my candle, and slung my lanthorn to a hook at my back, and watched them, but lost sight of them in the Cole yard; then I went and called Mr. King the constable, who came with a hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the prisoners the men you saw in Newtoner's-Lane ?</p>
               <p>Maid. They are, my Lord; then we went to the house of Thomas Ind, at the Crown and Scepter in Drury-lane, and described the men; he said, he knew them both, and that they had been at his house that day; he charged a brace of pistols, and Mr. King, he, and I, went out, and in about half an hour, the two prisoners were stopped in Drury-Lane, and taken before the Justice. Those are the very men we saw against the wall and followed afterwards.</p>

On the 18th of December, Mr. Bugg, and the other evidences, came to my house; the two prisoners had been at my house about three o'clock that afternoon. I once fetched Hays from Salisbury goal, and, as I had ironed him, he said he'd come and pay me a visit; I was afraid he'd do me a mischief; they wanted to borrow a crown of me; Broughton wanted to leave the whip with me as a pledge; then Hays said, he'd not borrow, he'd go out and get some money; I said, James, don't go on the audacious lay, take care; he laugh'd and went out. After they had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190004"/> described them, I knew they must be the prisoners, they being dressed as they described; I loaded my pistols, and just as we were going out at my door, there was a cry of, Stop thief! in the street ; we went after them; they were stopped just before we came to them; when they were taken and brought before the Justice, I took a hanger-belt from off Broughton, he was brought in by the mob, one of which had a scabbard, which he said he took from him.</p>

I ran to Parker's-lane, and there Hays was running down Drury-lane with this hanger in his hand drawn, two men had once hold on him, but he got clear of them; and near Mr. Bugg's door he fell; I took hold on him, he dropt the hanger as he fell ; I searched his pockets, and found six or seven shillings, and some halfpence, but no penknife.

            . I am constable in St. George, Bloomsbury : I was employed to search for some leather that was lost, which I found in the custody of the prisoner at the bar: In September last he was sent to prison, and detained as an evidence ; when the prosecutrix, I, and Mary Jones, went to see him in prison; she knew him and he likew ise knew her; she said she was sure he was the man that robbed her, and he owned she was the woman that was robbed in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prosecutrix to go ?</p>
               <p>James. She came and told me she heard there was a man taken that had committed many robberies in and near Drury-lane, and desired to go to see if she knew him. When she asked him how he did, he said, Dame, I don't know you: said I, don't you remember such a time you robbed me in Drury lane; he said, I know you are the woman, it was of an apron and silk handkerchief, and thirteen-pence in money, and that he cut her over the eye, and pointed up to her eye, saying, it was this eye, I believe. (The prosecutrix shewed a scar, which, she said, he made.) He said also, he went to the Fox and Goose, and spent her money, and shared the things, there being others concerned.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever heard before of any such relation ?</p>

             advance to Capt. Agnue 24 guineas, and saw Capt. Agnue sign the note which I had produced. I then examined Gale; he said very little but this, I can swear the same to every thing that Mr. Fox has said; he said also he was a Broker, and liv'd behind Guy's Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew them the note?</p>
               <p>Dagg I think Fox took it out of my hand as I held it ; I shew'd Gale the note, he looking upon it said, he saw it signed by Capt. Agnue. I kept the note, and charged Mr. Welch with the three prisoners. I was with them before the Justice of Peace, they were examined separately; they agreed in this, that they were all three at the Lebeck's Head with Capt. Agnue when he signed the note and received the money; that they were drinking a pint of hot red wine; I knowing he had not drank red wine for some time before he died, I asked whether he drank one or two glasses, they could not tell; they all gave a different account of their coming there; one said Capt. Agnue and they came together; another said they met him as they were going in, and another said they came separate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Colonel Steward. Had Capt. Agnue us'd to drink red wine lately?</p>
               <p>Col. Steward. He drank no red wine for a year and half before he died.</p>
               <p>Q. from Gale. Did not I say, I did not know Capt. Agnue?</p>
               <p>Dagg. He did, before the Justice; but he had owned before he had seen Capt. Agnue sign it. I wanted him to be an evidence; he said, if I would put him on the back of the bill, he would do what service he could; said I, can you prove the forgery? he said he could not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mackenzey. What Mr. Dagg has said is the truth of the case. Fox said he knew the Captain very well, for he was the son of Sir

            , an attorney, had got my money, and had kept it two years, and I wanted him to help me to another: I offered him my papers to look at; he told me he never employed any attorney in London: said I, if you don't know of one, will you preserve this money for me; he said he'd do me all the favour possible : I gave him it: he said, I'll give you a memorandum: said I, if it was for a thousand pounds, I am sure of it; there was a young gentleman with him said, yes, you shall have a memorandum: he called for a pen and ink and gave it to the gentleman, I never minded it more till he handed me the paper.</p>

               <p>As Mr. Gale and I were coming from Chairing-Cross, Mr. Agnue called me in at the Lebeck's Head, where I saw the gentleman whom they called Captain ; they were busy in talking together; he asked about money, whether it was giving or receving, I cannot tell, it was not my business; I saw some money deposited on the table, how much, or the use of it, I cannot tell. I can say no more, I may as well be hang'd for nothing.</p>

               <p>There was some money on the table, but for what I can't tell; afterwards he said there were twenty-four guineas; it was something about a law-suit; I am pretty old and my memory fails me; I never saw the Captain before in my life.</p>

(I thinking it had been my husband) said he, it is none of your husband: he put his hand into the bed, and laid hold on me, and said, but I will do so and so to you, make no resistance, your husband will be at home in two minutes: I catched hold on him: he said, be quick, for I will, speaking in a very vulgar manner: I held him fast by the coat; said I, how came you into my house? he said, G - d blast your eyes, you old b - h! I said, Lord, what makes you use me so? who are you? will not you, you old b - h, speaking it out in a vulgar manner: then, said he, go to hell and be d - d for a b - h: then I felt my things going off the bed: I lost three candlesticks from off my mantlepiece, a cheque apron, a cap, a hood that hung on the chair, one brass pepperbox, one gridiron, three brass knobs off a stove, and a fireshovel: he went out and pulled the door after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any instrument in his hands?</p>
               <p>R. Cook. He threatened me and affrighted me so, that I did not see any thing in his hands. I saw the back of him as he went out, and when he was in the street, I saw him out of the window by the light of a brandy-shop. I was drawing on my stockings when my husband came in; he asked me if I was mad; I told him there had been a man, that came once before with a pretence to take a room, (which were all the times I had seen him) and had taken such and such things: my husband looked about to see what was gone: I described him and he went to the alehouses. When he was gone the prisoner came upon me a second time; then I saw his face and his cloaths; he said, G - d d - n you, you old bitch: I said you are the man that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190015"/> robbed me ; then he went like an arrow out of a bow, and turned down Turk's-head-conrt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out when you were in bed, when became to you?</p>
               <p>R. Cook. He threatened me so that I was affrighted, and had not power,</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the man?</p>
               <p>R. Cook. I can say, to my great sorrow, that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come into your room?</p>
               <p>R. Cook. The key was left on the outside the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>R. Cook. About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to bed so soon?</p>
               <p>R. Cook. I was taken with a great heaviness and was so for some days.</p>
               <p>Clarles Hilton. On the 13th of December, between eight and nine o'clock, as I went out at my own door, which is just by the corner of Green-Artour court, within a door or two of Mr. Cook's, I saw the prisoner, with a candle lighted in his hand, standing as if he was making water; About half an hour after Mrs. Cook came running to me, and said she had been robbed of every thing she had in the world, and that her husband was standing like a man out of his wits.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was drinking at a publick-house that night from six to nine, when I went away; I then went to the sign of the Three Pigeons to ask for my wife; she was not there; I then went to the house I had been drinking at, and when I came home found my door broke open: there were two or three men took told of me, and said I had robbed the prosecutrix; they brought her to me in a ragged gown: said she I am almost sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I got up the next morning when my maid asked me if I had left the buroe open: I went to it and missed the money. She said the street door and the warehouse door were open. I took my maid, my man, taat boy, and a fellow-servant with him before the Lord Mayor: the prisoner was servant to a lodger of mine: I got a search warrant from my Lord to search the house of the fellow servant to the prisoner: I went but found nothing; then I searched another house, but found nothing; after that a person that keeps a chandler's shop-by the Fleet-gate, came to me and said, there is a boy that lodges in your house has purchased six pounds worth of crackers and serpents: I desired him to stop him if he should come again. After that when Mr. Barnard was robbed of his gold watch, four guineas, two shillings, and other things, he suspected the prisoner: he asked him in my hearing concerning it; the prisoner denied it. I heard something of him, which gave me reason to suspect him; we took him before the Alderman; going along he confessed the fact to Mr. Barnard: then he confessed to me, and then before my Lord-Mayor, and several Aldermen, that he picked the lock, and broke open the buroe, and took out a pigtail wig; that he drank some green usquebaugh, and another man, a breeches-maker, was in company with him, he staid till he had but four guineas left: when going to Newgate, he then confessed that he took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190016"/> the money himself, that the money and gold watch were upon the leads on the house, and the breeches and wig were put down the vault; that he spent my money in whoring, half a guinea at a time to a girl, in drinking, in birds and cages; that he had given eight guineas to girls, and lost about ten pounds out of a hole where he had hid it, and that he never went out of an errand but he had a coach, and generally drove it himself; he said he lent five guineas to a cheer-woman, and some of it went to the curing him of a clap.</p>

On the 26th of December, about three o'clock in the morning, two men came in and called for three pints of beer: before the boy could get down into the cellar, one of the men said, I am surprized to see you so dilatory, to be up yourself and have your cellar window open, than opens in the street: immediately the boy, in the cellar called out Aunt! Aunt ! here is a thief in the cellar. I ran down, saw the prisoner at the bar, with a silver tankard in his hand; he put his hand over a butt, dropt the tankard, and it broke a powdering pan. I took hold of him, and asked him what business he had there! The watchman came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that window fast do you know before?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. I am sure it was, there was a plate broke from the kirb.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a window was it?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. It is a standing door and a slap under it, and stairs to go down; I had just put two tankards on a butt-head before, one of which he had.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he let fall this tankard behind the butt he took it from?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. No, my Lord, it was two butts distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have fallen there by rowling from the place where it stood?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. No, it could not, without the butt had fell. (She produced two tankards, and deposed it was one of them, but she could not tell which.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be up at that time?</p>
               <p>A. Ward. Our house is an ale-house and watchhouse too, there is one room for the constable to sit in.</p>

(Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilmot. On the 28th of January, about seven in the evening, the prisoner brought the silver mug to my house, and said his name was Durham, and that he lived at the glass-house in Fleet-street: said I, you are not that Mr. Durham: he said he was his brother; said I, if your brother will come and satisfy me it is yours, I'll lend you money upon it: I sent my servant over to Mr. Durham's to enquire, and in that time the prisoner desired I'd either let him have some money on it, or the tankard again: I said, I did not chuse that; he threatened me, and went from the shop; I laid hold on him; he turned about and we collared each other; I kept him till my man came back, who said Mr. Durham was not at home; then the prisoner mentioned another man in the neighbourhood, one Mr. Clark, whom he knew, who advertises to take things out of pawn; Mr. Clark let me know the prisoner had been there, that he did not know any thing of him: then I sent over to Mr. Durham for some body to come to confront the prisoner; the maid came and said, the prisoner was not her master or master's brother; he still insisted upon it that his name was Durham. I asked him if he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190018"/> what letters were upon the handle? he answered he did not know: then I sent for a constable; he called after the young man and said, he need not go for a constable, but told us where he had it, saying, it was Mr. Butler's of King-street, Clare-Market ; then I sent for Mr. Butler.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Ask Mr. Butler what was my character before?</p>

               <p>Mr. Arlington. Last Sunday morning, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was sent for to Mrs. Sedgwick's house, she said her buroe was broke open, and desired I'd go up stairs to the maid; the maid did not care I should see her searched, so I went into another room, and when I came back again Mrs. Sedgwick had got those things in her hand, saying, she has robbed me of them; I shewed them to the prisoner, and asked her if she had took them out of the buroe? she answered, she did, and also cut the hole in the drawer with a penknife; then I sent for the Headborough, she was carried before the Justice, and said the same there.</p>

               <p>William Roberts. On the 17th of January coming from Westminster to Kensington, where my master lodges, about seven in the evening, in the <placeName id="t17520219-36-crimeloc175">foot-path betwixt Hide-Park-corner and Knightsbridge</placeName>

I counted it before I came from Westminster; I turned from him, and on the other side of the way was, I suppose, a companion of his: he came across the way, and asked the prisoner, what he had got? the prisoner said but little, the other said D - n him I'll have his hat and wig: I ran, and got off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to discern him so as to be certain to him?</p>
               <p>Roberts. The moon shone as bright as it could shine, he had a very black beard at that time, as he has now; his shoes were slit up the sore parts, I described him to my fellow-servants at Kensington, dressed as he is now: if I was not positive, I would not swear for a world.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a cap on?</p>
               <p>Roberts. He had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This cap I have on I had of the person that was tried yesterday for stealing the mahogany, I never had it on before.</p>

I had bought several tickets before upon his recommendation. He brought the woman to the Bull-head in about a quarter of an hour; she went by the name of

He brought the will also. The woman said, she did not understand selling tickets, not being used to it; so said she would leave it to Mr. Andrews. I agreed with him by the woman's consent, and paid the money upon the table; Andrews took it up, saying to the woman, you'll give me leave to take up the money</p>

Then the prisoner ordered me to write a note, which I did by his directions, and he signed it, it has been read here. The woman was sitting in the window. Andrews ordered me to write that, she signed: then she came and made the letter E to it as her mark. I cannot say, as I was backwards and forwards, that I saw any money paid.</p>

I did, that was presently after, the man with the white coat had hold on him at the same time; I don't know how much she took, but Kemp said afterwards it was a guinea; after this the old woman consented I should go out by myself, but not the others; but I would not go without my comrades, so we all four went out.</p>

( Speeks also by an interpreter) I was one of the four that went into this house at that time; we were called in by somebody, but don't know who; I never was there before in my life; we had some two-penny, two of us had no more money; we had some victuals also, for which they charged us a shilling each, and a shilling for one of the girls that eat; I went up stairs with a woman about two hours, when I came down stairs the house was all in an alarm; I could not tell what was the matter, I saw a man in a white coat with a hanger, I took hold round his neck and begged he would not hurt my comrades, but let us go; my comrade was cut before I came down.</p>

               <p>Anstiss Birmingham. I lodge in Gillfoy's house; these four Dutchmen came in when I was gone out; I returned between 7 and 8 ; she said to me, here is some Dutchmen come, and I don't understand them; I was curious to talk with them, so asked them where they came from; they said from Hamburgh ; I had lived there 12 years, and could talk the language; I asked 'em some questions, they called for Twopenny and victuals, and seeing me a poor woman, desired Mrs. Gillfoy to let me have some victuals, and they'd pay for me ; once they wanted to pledge a waistcoat to pay the reckoning; one of the prisoners said no, that is the way a man had lik'd to have lost his life once by a Dutchman: upon my oath I never saw a hanger drew upon any body; I left them all good friends, and went to bed; I lay behind the counter in the shop, with the children; Bennings had been in the house about half an hour before I went to bed. I never saw no ill usage.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men were there in the house?</p>
               <p>Birmingham. There were the four Dutchman, Bennings, Nevill, and I believe the man of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bennings. Did you see this witness there ?</p>
               <p>Bennings. I did, she was very drunk, and the other prisoner at the bar said, if she would not go to bed, she'd turn her out of doors, so she went to bed, and was asleep when the Dutchmen were robbed.</p>
               <p>Lowders. This evidence Birmingham came on board our ship afterwards, and desired us to make it up, she said they would give us some money so to do. The other three Dutchman said the same.</p>

            's house is there; about nine o'clock at night I had information, that two iron bars were gone from the rails at his door. I went to the end of the street, there I saw the prisoner sitting on some logs at the end of Rathbourne Place, and was tying up two bars in an apron. (Produced in Court) I took him and the bars; I compared them to the place where they were taken from, and know them to be Sir Francis's property: I found an old chisel upon him, with which I suppose he broke the stone they stood in.</p>

               <p>As I was going from Fleet-market, I sat down upon the logs to tye my stocking up, I saw something lie white; then I took my apron off to wrapt them in, and designed next day to enquire who had lost such things; the watchman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190034"/> came and took me along with him, and I gave him a chisel that lay on the bars.</p>

I live at Hoxton ; on the night the murder was committed I was going home about a quarter after eleven; when I came to the step, in upper Moorfields I heard the guns going off in the Artillery ground, it was a day that the Artillery went out; when I came within about 20 yards of the body, I saw two men standing by it; this was in the Barking Dogs walk I came up to them and said, holloe ! what is the matter? one of them said, I believe a gentleman is here murdered; I found the body in a strange posture lying by the side of the pales, in a deep rutt, partly on one side, with his hat and wig off; I took hold of the hand, it was very warm; I lifted the body up, he seemed as if he would have spoke if he could; I laid him on his back, he was so limp that he would not lie as I laid him, but he fell down again; then these two men said, you had better not meddle with him, you may be brought into bad bread. I said, I was well known there. (These were men going by, I don't suppose they were the men that did him the hurt.) I saw some blood, and could feel a quantity with inside his cloaths. I went to go to the sign of the Two Asles, and met two or three man with a lanthorn; I went back with them to the man in about ten minutes, I then took hold of his hand, and found a great alteration in him; he was then lying almost on one side quite dead, (he had life when I left him) he had on the very same coat and waistcoat produced here, which I saw on him then, and the next morning at the watch-house.</p>

            . I am fourteen years of age. (He answered well as to the consequence of false swearing, after which he was sworn.) On the eleventh of June I was in Hoxton road, I went for my master Adkerson, who had been among the Artillery company; the moon was up, but it was a sort of a misty night, the moon at that time was in a cloud; as I was going to the Artillery-ground, I saw three men standing together about a hundred yards from where the murder was committed; two of the men were for size like the evidence and the prisoner, but I don't swear to them; they seemed to be going backwards and forwards; when I came back I told my master of these men which I had seen as I was going; that they were sauntring about, they did not seem to go one way or another, I thought they intended no good; my master said keep a look out, we'll take care of ourselves; after my master had turned at the corner, he called out, Jack, Tom, or such like names.</p>

            . I am a Surgeon, I examined the body the 13th of June last, when the Coroner sat on it; there were two wounds on the left side of the breast, one penetrated quite into the body; the other not so far, that went against a rib; the deep one I believe must reach the heart and lungs, the breadth was about an inch and a quarter; he had another wound near the pit of the stomach, rather to the right, it went upwards into the body four or five inches; there was a wound on the lower part of the ear, into the neck, seemed to be a very narrow one; I apprehend that might be a mortal one (he is shewed the knife, coat and waistcoat, he observed the wounds in the body seemed to him to be given with the knife; he compared the knife to the cuts on the coat, they fitted exactly; the cuts in the waistcoat were not so big as them in the coat or body: which being linnen would easier give way to the knife<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190037"/> knife than the woollen, and after washing close again as not cut.</p>

I had these cloaths on new made which I have now; when I came away the prisoner gave me a pair of scissars to put a revit in, and desired me to bring them as soon as I could, saying they were for his wife ; I came there on Tuesday the 11th at night, I asked for him; my mother told me he was very ill? I said how long has he been ill, he was not on Sunday; my mother said he was taken till that day; I went up stairs to him; I can't say whether he was in the bed or not, he was upon it; his great coat lay on the bed, and his other cloaths hung on the back of a chair; his hat and wig hung up, and he had a red cap on: I had no conversation with him; giving him the scissars he said he was not very well : and seemed as though he had a cold upon him.</p>

On the 27th of January , between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I heard a violent groaning over my head; I went up stairs to see what was the matter; I heard it again as I was going. I went to the prisoner's door, and said, For God's sake what is the matter, open the door. Nobody answered. There were other woman that lived above came down to his door; they heard it, and told me I should break open the door: I ran down to the street door, and called out for help, and said somebody had come to ill use my lodgers. As I turned to go up stairs again, the prisoner was going out of his room with his key in his hand, having locked his door: I asked him what was the matter; he answered, Nothing ; and came down stairs: the women being nearer him than me, asked me what he said, as they did not understand French: I told them; they said, O a rogue, his cloaths is all covered with blood. He went to the street door and was stopped by Mr. Whitson, who asked him for the key of his room; he pretended at first not to find it: he went up to his room and broke the door open: Mr. Whitson spoke to him in English: I believe the prisoner understands English enough to know what he said. The prisoner told me afterwards, that the deceased, he and his wife, had breakfasted together; after which he sent his wife with some linnen to wash, and he shut his door as usual: when the deceased found the door was locked he demanded money of him; that he answered, he was a poor man and had no money but what he worked hard for; that then the deceased took up the knife to kill him, and that the knife was the deceased's. I told him, if he had cried out any body would have come to his assistance. I was examined before the justice, where I said the knife produced was the prisoner's, and that a five weeks ago he came down to me to have it ground; there the prisoner owned the knife. Upon the Friday before this happened he asked me whether the necessary house went into the river, or whether I ever emptied it: he told me he had dropped a tin snuff-box in it: I answer'd, if it was a silver one it would not allow emptying it for that ; that I had lived there five years, and never knew it emptied. I did not see the deceased come; there is a passage to go to the prisoner, and he might come that way without my knowledge. I saw the deceased after he was dead, lying, but I could not bear to look at him; I saw a great deal of blood all over the chairs and drawers. His wife did not return till three days after; she was gone out before this groaning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing besides the groaning?</p>
               <p>M. Tiboe. I heard a sort of a struggling in the room as if it were two men fighting; I heard no words pass, nor blows. I saw the prisoner's fore finger on his left hand, and the third on his right hand were cut; I saw no cuts on his cloaths, he looked very ghastly, like as if he was affrighted.</p>

            . I took the prisoner as he was going out at the street door. As I was passing by about nine o'clock that morning, there were two girls standing at the door, and said they cry'd murder within: he had a napkin wiping his hand, extremely bloody, as though he had fell into a pool of blood: he made no-resistance. I asked him how he came to be so bloody; he shewed me the end of his finger which was bloody, and talked in a foreign language that I did not understand: the women said he had locked his door, and they could not get in; then I demanded the key of him ; immediately he answered montea le beaut : which I understood to be up stairs: no, no, said one of the women, he has taken the key with him. I again asked him for the key, and insisted upon having it: he again answered, montea le beaut. I desired the people to take hold of him while I went up and broke the door open; but nobody cared to do it: then I took him up stairs; there I demanded the key resolutely, and threatned him : by his motions I understood he had not got it, or he would not give it me: I clapt my shoulder to the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175202190039"/> and broke it open: I saw some small matter of blood in the fore room, and in a passage that leads to a back room; I saw a man lying on his back in a most terrible condition, his throat was cut across, other people came into the room. and one took up a knife that lay about two too. from the dead body, it was all over bloody; I said to the prisoner how could you be so cruel to murder this poor creature? he made many motions and put up his hand to his own throat, what he meant by it I can't tell; I saw the deceased stripped after, he had a wound on his left breast that the surgeon said had gone quite to his heart; there were several other wounds, I saw about seven or eight; the left hand thumb was cut on the inside, it appeared as if it was done by defending himself; there was another stab in his right breast, it was visible; these wounds were the occasion of his death; the cloaths seem'd to be shov'd up under his arms, all extreamly bloody ; I believe he was finished where he lay, out I could perceive by the blood that the main struggle was in the inward room having a great effusion of blood in several parts of it; I did not observe the pockets, to see if they had been rifled; there was a case knife lay on the table, that did not seem to have been made use of; I sent for a constable, he did not chuse to come, the mob said they would take care of him, so I delivered him to them to take him before the Justice : I saw a wound on the prisoner's finger, that was all I saw, I believe it is almost impossible to cut the other as he had done, without receiving some wound from his own knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his wound appear to be given as he might be endeavouring to take the knife from the deceased ?</p>
               <p>Whitson. No, it did not: if so, it would have been on the inside, but this was not.</p>

             I was lodger in this house ; in a room above the prisoner, about half an hour after eight that day, I heard many dismal groans, very terrible ones; I called another woman who lodged in the house; we went to the prisoner's door, the groaning was ceased by that time; we stood and heard a voice talking as though there were company in the room, we heard like a laughing, but I can't say I heard above one voice, we insisted upon having the door open; he opened it, and held it a little way open and asked what we wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in English?</p>
               <p>M. White. He said (vat you vant, all be very vell here ) I seeing part of his left shoulder, and that bloody, I called out murder, he locked the door, I went up stairs to put on a handkerchief, which was about four or five minutes at most; while I was gone he came out and fastened the door; and was going down stairs, but was secured. She exactly agreed with the former witnesses in the rest of the evidence.</p>
               <p>Salomey Ireland. I lodge in a two pair of stairs in that house; about half an hour after eight that morning, I heard a dreadful groaning; I ran down with a hammer in my hand to the prisoner's door; in some space of time he looked out and said nothing was the matter, all was well there, then shut the door and locked it; he being within side, we seeing him very bloody, called out murder; the rest as the former witnesses.</p>

               <p>Axtonio Arcrety.

               <p>The prisoner in his defence said, he was formerly a papist priest, and had changed it to that of the protestant religion; for which he was envy'd, and in danger of his life, by the deceased, and other catholicks; and this was done in his own defence, &amp;c.</p>
