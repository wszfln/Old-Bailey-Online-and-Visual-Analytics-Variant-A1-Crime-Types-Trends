               <p>Court. Then you cannot speak to the person of the prisoner? - No, I cannot, I saw them take these spoons, and the milk pot, I am sure all this plate was in the house at the time they entered it , and there was a watch hanging by the chimney side, that was gone.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Thompson, I was there on the 10th of March, 1784; a quarter past seven in the evening, there was a small knock at the door, I was in the fore parlour with my mistress; my mistress said, somebody knocks at the door, I went to the door, and before I opened it, I called who is there, and a man said he had a letter of importance, which letter I have now in my pocket. (Produced, being a sheet of blank paper addressed to Miss Young, Islington.) With that I opened the door, and a man presented the letter, I had a candle in my hand when I saw the direction I told him it was not for us or anybody in the house, and he did not give me the letter into my hand, but they all rushed in; and to the best of my knowledge, I always thought there were six, but it appeared by evidence upon the last trial there were but five; when they entered the passage, I shrieked out Lord Jesus! we shall all be killed, and one of the men seized me by the throat, I cannot say who he was, whilst<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290004"/> I was leaning my back against the passage, I begged of them to let me go into the parlour; one of them had hold of one arm, and the other of the other, and they led me into the fore parlour, and my mistress schrieked out, and one of them had gags, and swore he would gag us; another man, a tall one, who has turned evidence, had a cutlass, and said he would cut her down; I saw more than four in the room, two of them left the room, and those that were left in the room, one had a pistol, and the other a cutlass; we heard the others up stairs in the rooms, pulling the drawers about; some time after that, a short man came down in fustian breeches and jacket, he was pock-fretted; he could not open the desk immediately, and he took the tongs and wrenched it, but what he took out I did not then know; this was in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there? - I saw that man to the best of my knowledge among them in the parlour, for he struck me when I came here to-day, I have not seen him since; it strikes me he is the man that had the gags in his hands.</p>
               <p>Do you imagine he is one of the men that stood in the parlour all the time? - No, he was not, I am perfectly sure of that, I should have known them three seven years after, I have not such a perfect knowledge of him, I have no great doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Have you any? - I cannot directly say to the face of the man, but he is remarkably like the man in his make about the shoulders, I think he is the man that had the gags; I have not so striking a likeness of him as I have of the other three: the plate was always kept in a little round basket, what we used at dinner, and the child had got some of the plate out, and was playing with the basket; there was one salt-seller, and two spoons, and the old pepper-caster, the rest were in the back parlour of the beaufet .</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the prisoner at the bar was <rs id="t17850629-2-deflabel10" type="occupation">servant</rs>

On Friday the 8th of April, the day before the fire, Mr. Parsloe had been bottling some wine, and he finished it about nine; he ordered his porter to remove the straw, and take it to a back part of the house, every thing was perfectly safe at that time; about ten, a servant was ordered to go down into the cellar for some beer, and he went without a candle, and at that time there was no light; some time afterwards he went down again for some more beer, without a candle; and then every thing was safe; the boy desired the porter to lend him a candle to go and draw some beer for himself; says he I choose to have my beer cold; he took a candle, and went down into the cellar, and returned a few minutes after, and being asked for the candle, he said he had dropped it; the servants thought nothing then, but in a few minutes after they were alarmed with the smell of fire, and they found that some straw had been set on fire, not in the beer cellar; and that some corks that were upon some prickles for bottles were consumed: however, this was soon put out with some water; and the boy on going to bed was very inquisitive among the servants, whether supposing his master's house had been burnt, it would have ruined him or not; says he, I suppose if it was burnt down, then he would be ruined, and then he must turn me over, he would have no business for me; that night they sat up, but no more alarm happened; the next day in the afternoon, about six, or a quarter before, a Miss Wheeler, the daughter of Mrs. Parsloe, and a Mrs . Murrel, another daughter, had been up stairs; for as this is a house in the public way, their apartments were up stairs ; the last person that went up stairs was Mrs. Murrel; she came down from her own room, and went into her sister's room, for the purpose of shutting the windows; that was the room where the fire began; she said, she would not shut the windows, and she came down without a candle, and every thing was safe at that time; the boy at this time was very particular in his enquiries, whether all the family were at tea, and whether the ladies were at tea; they said yes; and while the waiter was going to clean some glasses, he observed the boy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290006"/> with a candle; he asked him to lend it him; says the boy no, I cannot lend you the candle, but I will stand by you and light you; while he was in the act of cleaning the glasses, and this boy holding the candle, the bell rang, the waiter left the boy in this closet with a candle, and went into his master's room with a decanter which was called for; there are two staircases to this house, and this boy stood at the glass-closet, near the two pair of stairs; the waiter having got the decanter carried it up the great stair-case, and when he got up the one pair of stairs, he met this boy coming down the two pair of stairs great stair-case without a candle; he was coming down in a great hurry, and went into the hall; in a very few minutes afterwards a cracking was heard in the room upstairs, Miss Wheeler's ro om, which had been left perfectly safe a few minutes before; the servants said, what is that cracking, the boy immediately said, there is a fire in my master's house? the fire was exceeding rapid, and the house was intirely consumed. Gentlemen, these are the facts to bring this charge home to the prisoner; the magistrate thought proper to commit him, and you are to judge from those circumstances, and some others, of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner. Offences of this kind must always from the nature of the case depend upon circumstances, because if persons are wicked enough to set fire to the house of another, they always do it with that degree of caution, not that they shall be seen in the very act; but if these circumstances, when put together, are strong enough to convince you that this boy was the perpetrator of the offence, you will say so; if not, I am sure from the knowledge I have of you, you will do your duty in acquitting him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I am fifteen.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. On the Friday I was bottling some wine by the cellar, and there were some prickles stood there, and I ordered the porter to take them away, they were full of straw, and I told the boy to light him, that was about eight ; they were carried away, and the prisoner lighted the porter up the garden with them; I then went up stairs to clean myself, and about ten I had some bread and cheese, and about half after ten one of the maid servants came up, and said the cellar was on fire; upon that we all came down stairs, and there were some people came, and I went down to the door that led to the cellar, and we kept the door fast for fear it should get a head, and the people went into the street and threw some water, and put the fire out, the fire was near to the cellar door.</p>
               <p>[The plan of the house and cellar shewn to the Court.]</p>
               <p>Court. Was this fire within the house? - Yes, by the passage leading to the cellar door.</p>
               <p>What was on fire there? - There was corks in a basket, and several bottles broke, and a paper bag; it was put out, and I and one of my daughters sat up till four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose nobody had seen this, were those corks near any combustible matter, or any part of the house? - It was quite close to the wall.</p>
               <p>What was the wall built of? - Brick and plaister; there was a shelf which was standing over the prickles.</p>
               <p>What was the floor? - It was a stone floor.</p>
               <p>Then there was no likelihood of this communicating to the house? - Yes, my Lord, there was an oil cask stood very near it, with thirty-six gallons of oil in it.</p>
               <p>How near? - At a very little distance.</p>
               <p>What do you call a very little distance? - About three yards</p>
               <p>How long had it been there? - About two days; I staid up till about four in the morning, and every thing was perfectly safe.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290007"/>Mr. Silvester. After the straw and the hamper had been removed, had any body any occasion to go into that place? - No, it was shut up, nobody had any business there, they could go to it two or three ways.</p>
               <p>Was the way to it through the beer cellar? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Which way were they to get to it then? Look at this plan.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. He can state the fact without the plan ; I know nothing of the authenticity of the plan.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no occasion to look at the plan.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Could they go to this place from the beer cellar? - Yes, on the Saturday I was drinking tea, between six and seven, and one of my daughters said, I think I smell a smell of fire now, no says my wife, there is nothing but what happened last night; I opened my door and saw my house all in flames, in consequence of which my house was burnt down to the ground.</p>

               <p>Jury. Had you any words with the boy? - He ran away from me three times, he never made any complaint; I had no suspicion of the boy, till I was informed by some of the servants, and I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe after the boy was taken up and sent to the watch-house you was so good to send him some money? - I believe I sent him a shilling.</p>
               <p>There were many applications made to him whilst he was in custody, to confess that he set the house on fire? - Only myself , I went to him, and pressed him a good deal, but he always said he did not.</p>
               <p>As to the situation of this place, it is a strong arch, I take it for granted? - No, it is not an arch.</p>
               <p>It is bricked then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was at the distance of three or four yards from this oil? - Three yards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I am desired to ask a fact, was this boy taken up by you before? - He had run away three times.</p>
               <p>Had you chastised him, or punished him in any way? - No, never, Sir, only told him to be a good boy.</p>

               <p>Why? - Because she has said so, and we must have seen her, it was very warm, and the doors were all open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You cannot affect to swear that she could not by possibility have been in that room without your knowledge? - Only by what she said.</p>

               <p>Where was he standing when he said that? - He was out of the door about three or four steps.</p>

               <p>I am a waiter at this house, on Saturday evening about a quarter past six, as I was standing in the passage leading to Mr. Parsloe's sitting room, the prisoner came by me to the larder with a lighted candle, the glass closet is close to the larder, where I was standing between the back stairs and the hall stairs, and on his return I asked him to lend me the candle, he told me he could not spare it, but he was not in a hurry, he would stop and light me, I asked him whether he was in a hurry, he said, he was not, he stopped there some minutes, I took away my glasses, and left him there; I do not know which way he went, it might be twenty minutes after that, that I saw him coming down the best stair case from the first landing without either candle or candlestick.</p>
               <p>How soon after you saw him was the alarm of fire? - I believe twenty-five minutes or half an hour, as near as I can say, where I left him was between the back stairs and the servants hall, I saw him afterwards coming down the great stairs, I do not know where he came from, he had no business that way; from the time that I saw him in the passage, to the time I saw him coming down the great stairs, was twenty-five minutes.</p>
               <p>How long was it between your seeing him without a candle, and the alarm of fire? - Five or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you say anything to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When you first saw him with the candle, he was about his necessary business? - I believe he was, he had business in the larder, but he might have fetched anything without a candle.</p>
               <p>Why, you wanted a candle yourself? - I could not see to wipe the glasses so clean.</p>
               <p>Why, then it was necessary for him to have a candle? - When I met him, I asked him where he had been, and he made no reply.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What occasioned you to leave off wiping your glasses? - To carry them into their proper place, then I carried a bottle of wine into the colonel's room, I went only once into the prosecutor's parlour; the larder and the glass closet, and the stairs, are close by the parlour, you must go by all them to go to it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290011"/> when the parlour door is open you may see the two stairs, in some situations of that room, there are frequent occasions for the servants and others to go into that parlour.</p>
               <p>The fire was very rapid? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When he was coming down the best stair-case, might he possibly be coming down from the parlour? - I met him on the one pair of stairs , on my left hand; you might go from the parlour door, but it was usual for the servants to go on the back stairs.</p>
               <p>The parlour is on the ground floor? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you ever given any particular description of the found of that foot? - I thought it was a woman's step, I could not particularly tell, it was not so heavy as a man's; I have described it to be the sound of a woman's, or some other person not so heavy as a man; I had been in bed eight or nine days, from an accident; the prisoner knew I was ill, and knew where I lay, my room door was wide open.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived at the house? - Almost three years, I have observed the boy's character and conduct; I never knew any blemish of his character, I had never any doubt of him before, I thought him an orderly well-behaved boy.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the boy ever bring you up any thing during your illness? - I do not recollect he did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, the boy has been ever since his confinement, very ill of a dangerous putrid fever, and therefore I think I ought to prevent his saying anything for himself, considering his state of intellects.</p>

               <p>It never went out of my sight.</p>
               <p>What became of it afterwards? - It was carried up to the office directly the alarm was made of stop thieves; as soon as I heard that I took hold of Mr. Noble by the collar; Master, says I, you have stolen this trunk; he had got up to the coach, and was putting it into a hackney coach, there was but one on the stand, at the same time the people came running up the street, and made the alarm of stop thieves; he was taken directly.</p>

               <p>I was robbed on Monday the 2d of May, about half after three in the afternoon, I was going down to Enfield from London, I was stopped in a lane at the back of Hornsey wood , I believe it is called <placeName id="t17850629-4-crimeloc20">Hornsey-lane</placeName>

               <p>Can you swear to him positively? - I did and do.</p>
               <p>Be cautious? - I am very cautious, I am sure it is him, it was about half after three on Monday, it was a very bad road, and I was walking my horse down hill, and about twenty yards before me I saw three men in sailors apparel, I did not conceive them to be footpads, but rather thought them to be three men loitering about, I did not suspect being stopped at that time of the day, when they came near to my horse's head the prisoner who was in the middle, gave the others a shove with his elbow, as I thought for me to go through them, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290014"/> I endeavoured to do, and they every one sprang upon me, one on each side of me, and the other at my mare's head; I asked them what they wanted; the prisoner first said, damn your blood, give us your watch and money; upon which he immediately laid hold of the chain of my watch, and attempted to pull it out of my pocket, which broke the chain; not finding it possible to get my watch out of my pocket, he immediately ripped my breeches open.</p>
               <p>Did he draw a knife? - The left-hand man held a cutlass to my head, and the prisoner immediately took the watch out of my pocket, and I gave him my purse; on the other side the man with the cutlass put his hand into my pocket, and took out a large tooth-pick case, for which I begged very hard, as I had had it many years, but he swore at me, and would not return it: before they had got twenty paces from me, they turned round again, swearing they would murder me if I did not go along, upon which I was determined to pursue them, I met a soldier, and he went back with me; when we got to the top of the hill, we saw them crossing the field.</p>
               <p>At what distance? - About one hundred yards from the lane, the man immediately got over the gate, and pursued them, and I went to have leaped the gate after them, but he thought it was rather wrong to do that, and I rode on as hard as I could ride, at Newington-green I met a gentleman, with his servant, and we both rode after them; I went to Sir Sampson Wright's office, where I gave intelligence: they were not taken up till the Friday week afterwards; it was on a Monday that I was robbed, I saw them on that day fortnight; the prisoner was with two more .</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of the other two men? - I am very well assured they were not with him at the time I was robbed.</p>
               <p>How many minutes did the robbery last? - I do not suppose it was five minutes ; I took particular notice of them, though I had not an idea of what they were going to do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is no occasion for me to ask any questions, as the gentleman is so positive that I am the person, there is no room to ask any questions.</p>

               <p>Court. Is there a possibility of getting to the window but by a ladder? - I looked over the bannisters and saw the back yard door wide open, upon that, I imagined somebody had broke into the house, I went and called the house maid, the spoons were kept on a side-board in the knife case in the fore parlour, which is on the ground floor, it shuts with a pulley; we then went into the garden, and looking up to the window, which I saw open up stairs, there was a ladder fixed against it, our own ladder, all the things mentioned in the indictment were missing from the side-board; I saw the things a very little while before, but I cannot recollect whether I saw them the day before, I saw them at the justices, and I knew them to be the prosecutor's property.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the sash was down before you put the shutters to? - Yes, there was no fastening at all upon it, it was only down; then I put to the shutter, there are no others windows of this room, all the other windows were shut up, I cannot say that I shut them all up, but I saw them all shut up at the lower part of the house, I saw the doors all fastened, and the door of the back yard was locked that night and bolted; but I cannot speak to the upper part of the house, these things were kept on the side board in the fore parlour .</p>

               <p>Court. If he is not here you cannot identify the tobacco? - White weighed the tobacco by a little pair of steel-yards, then he put it down on the ground, then I said to White, hand me that tobacco.</p>
               <p>Court. You heard no conversation pass then between White and Sawyer? - No, my Lord, I saw him give it him, White threw it over the settle to me, and said damn you, if you will have it, take it; I took it up, I directly took him to the Compter, Sawyer made out of the public house, I have seen him on the keys for this year and half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Sawyer. He went into the house with me, I asked him to go and drink a glass with me.</p>

               <p>I am cellar-man to the prosecutor; I know nothing of the loss of the bottles. On the 27th of May, I was called upon by Justice Hyde's men to search some suspicious bottles, and in Lowther's house we found these two bottles, which I challenged as being marked exactly like ours, with an A. I think they were in the cellar, as far as there is a possibility of swearing to a mark, I can swear to this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Council. Is it possible at all to swear to them? - I do not know there is any other mark that is the same, it is an A.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear that that bottle was ever in your house? - I can swear no more than to the mark.</p>
               <p>I believe Lowther is a dealer in bottles? - He keeps a bottle shop.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you used that mark? - About two years.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any other mark? - There is no other mark.</p>
               <p>- JENNIWAY sworn.</p>
               <p>I recollect the prisoner Oates, I have seen him in my own shop, I live in No. 8, Charles-court, St. James's square, I recollect he brought me a few bottles, scale time past.</p>
               <p>When was that? - To the best of my recollection, it was about five or six months ago, I bought a few of him, my husband is a broker.</p>
               <p>Who did he use to come in company with? - By himself.</p>

               <p>Court. Whose bottles were these? - We had carried some full bottles to the Prince of Wales's , they were my master's bottles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. Did you look at them? - No, I did not pack them up.</p>

I had only bid her go about her business; I have lived in that house going on sixty years; I had a warrant for her to take her up, to make her give bail for her better behaviour for the future.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. I fancy I shall make an end of this business, by a word or two with this old gentleman; you thought it was a good thing to get her bailed , then you had her? - I had nothing but honour and honesty in me.</p>
               <p>That is certain, my old buck! - She had left my service about a year and a quarter.</p>
               <p>How many of your apprentices boarded and lodged with her by your desire? - There was one, and I gave a bond to his relation that he should be at liberty at five years .</p>
               <p>That is, in defiance of law, and in spite of the indentures, you gave them up in five years; did not this young man, your apprentice live with her? - He did live with her, he cohabited with her.</p>
               <p>Is not she a married woman? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>What do you believe? - He lay out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290023"/> my house, and lay with her; no more of my apprentices went there; here is one that went backward and forward.</p>
               <p>So that a year and a half after you took her up for stealing these things; was you there when they were found? - The constable told me they were in a public room.</p>
               <p>- DUPREE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Thornes , I have been out of my time between three and four years; I saw the looking-glass, the pictures, and the china; I knew them to be Mr. Thorne's property, because the pictures had hung all my apprenticeship in my room.</p>
               <p>Do you know who took them away? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of pictures were there ? - Old pictures.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of them for any other purpose but keeping out the wind? - I do not know; I had been at this woman's house to get the apprentice to work, he used to board and lodge there.</p>

               <p>I have witnesses where I bought some of these things, an d he has had my sheets and blankets, and some of my blankets remained upon the apprentice's bed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Council. I will ask you one question ; did the prisoner immediately upon your speaking of the watch, say here it is, or to that purpose; did she conceal the watch? - No.</p>

             is my trustee; I let the prisoner a lodging in a lower room by the week, with goods in it; I missed the things in the indictment, I went there a fortnight after, about the 7th or 8th of May for rent, and I looked about and missed the things; I asked him about them, and he said, he would get them in again in a week or ten days; he said, his wife had pawned them, and he promised to give me some rent in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him, if he would get the things again you would not prosecute him? - Yes, but that was after he said he pawned the things, it was when the constable was there, he locked up the door, and went off afterwards; my first husband bought the furniture.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290034"/>Were the ribbons disposed of there? - Yes, at Mr. Levy's.</p>
               <p>Who was in company? - Lucas, Waters, and Summers, and these men were in the room; they were convicted a sessions or two ago.</p>
               <p>Was there any conversation where it came from or anything of the prisoner? - Yes, Waters said, it came from Covent-Garden.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner contradict that? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. How much did they sell Levy in the whole? - The ribbons came to six pounds nineteen shillings, and the lace to forty guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How much of this bargain had you? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>I believe you was to have half? - No, I had no half.</p>

               <p>They cheated you of your bargain? - I did not know any of their bargain, when I knew how they were got, I did not want half.</p>
               <p>So Waters told this young man, that the things came from Covent Garden? - They said that the business should be done quick, on account of it's being so near Bow-street.</p>

               <p>I went out to look for a day's work, and I thought it too early, and seeing this shed just by the foot-way, I went in to lay down for an hour or two, and in this shed there was some hay, and I thought to lay down in the hay, and this gentleman desired me not to stir, I said no, I shall not stir, I am going to lay down: but I am as innocent of the fact as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this indictment is founded on a statute for stealing a quantity of iron fixed to a dwelling-house, now the fact that is proved is, that it was not fixed to the dwelling-house, but fixed to the cow-house, and afterwards found in the cow-house, and though it is very probable the prisoner was the person who did wrench them: it would have been an offence at common law, but upon this evidence as applied to this indictment you must acquit the prisoner.</p>

I was sitting on the stair-case resting myself, I was not in liquor , nor in sleep; the prisoner asked me for a quartern of gin, and I immediately went into my room, I found my door shut, and the prisoner immediately ran down stairs, he did not speak to me; I found my chest broke open; the prisoner had been a ship-mate of mine, he had been in my icon several times before, I let him lay with me the night before, we have been pretty much together for this week, since I first saw him in London, I had not seen him years before; I saw him the next day and took him into custody, he was talking with a girl to make up matters to go to sleep with her; and he gave me two falls, she had like to have got away from me; on the Sunday morning I asked him for my property, he said if he had thirty pounds, he would give it me, then he told me he had sold my buckles for fourteen shillings, and pawned my watch for fifteen shillings.</p>

            , with intent to buy a pair of shoes of him, went to Mr. Oliver, No. 10, St. Clement's-lane; and was recommended by him to a friend of his in Field-lane, Holborn; returning home, I found three mahogany backs of chairs, between Fetter-lane, and Chancery-lane: I then in consequence thereof, went to Mr. Oliver's and acquainted him therewith, he agreed they should remain there, in expectation of their being advertised; after waiting eight or nine days, and not being advertised, I thought it would be proper to advertize them, in order to find the owner, the intended advertisement I accordingly drew up, as follows, viz.</p>
               <p>"To all master mahogany chair-makers,</p>
               <p>"who have lost any chair backs, wholly</p>
               <p>"framed and glazed, the back legs not</p>
               <p>"finished carving, may see them at No.</p>
               <p>"10, the corner of Plough-court, St. Clement's-lane,</p>
               <p>"and proving their property</p>
               <p>"therein, may have them again, on paying</p>
               <p>"the expences, &amp;c . - They were</p>
               <p>"found between Fetter-lane, and Chancery-lane,</p>
               <p>"Holborn.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of May, I had the intended advertisement ready, and meant then to have delivered it to the printer, but unluckily on that day fell, by treading on a piece of orange peal, on stone steps, and broke three of my ribs, and on the 11th was carried to the Westminster Infirmary, being in inexpressible agony, soon after after which I sent to Mr. Oliver, who came two or three times to see me, and the last time of his coming compelled me to go with him before a Magistrate (Justice Girdler) concerning the said chair backs - Then and there to my surprise, I found that Mr. Oliver had been endeavouring to sell them unknown to me. - So that by his misconduct, I was sent to New Prison, innocent I am of any crime respecting this affair, as the child unborn. - The above misfortune prevented me from publishing the intended advertisement, which I produced to the constable. - I was very unfit to be moved from the hospital to New Prison; the removal caused me to be confined to my bed three weeks; notwithstanding the care and skill of the doctor, and the indulgence and kindness of the wardsman; to whom I render my sincere thanks.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290043"/>Court to Oliver. Did the prisoner tell you how he found them, or how he came by them? - He did not, if he did I being deaf, I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Were they left with you on account of the debt that was due to you? - No, by no means in the world, they were only left in my house till he called for them.</p>
               <p>How came you to sell them? - Being distressed for money, and to pay myself what he owed me.</p>
               <p>Then you had no authority from him to do that? - No, I never heard any more of him.</p>
               <p>When did you receive the chairs? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How many days did you keep them before you carried them to Rockhead ? - I kept them near a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Did you get them in the morning or evening? - About six in the evening.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. I believe you was taken up for stealing this lace? - Not for stealing it.</p>
               <p>Court. That is only to her credit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit it goes a great deal further, it will go to her competency, to prevent her being let in now, she is the principal felon, there is no ground at present.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - A servant out of place, I lived with a painter and glazier, in St. James's-street, Covent Garden, at Mr. Saint Clare's, I was out of place at the time this lace was taken away; I went to drink tea with the prisoner Molly, and she asked me if I would sell some lace for her, I asked her how she came by it, she said it was given her by a person who came from abroad, I sold them for her, and she had the money, I delivered it to Mrs. Samuel, she sold it, she lives in St. Martin's-lane, I do not know how much there was, but I can tell you how much money there was, it was thread lace, a piece of lappeting at four shillings a yard.</p>
               <p>How much money was it? - First she had thirty-four shillings, then she had a guinea, and next eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the quantity of lace? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it once, or twice, or three times? - Three times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The lace that you received, you delivered to Mrs. Samuel? - Yes, I did not measure it, or take any particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>How much had you from Mrs. Samuel? - The same I gave her.</p>
               <p>You understood this was a bit of smuggled lace, did not you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Can you swear that these laces that Mrs. Samuel gave you are the same? - Yes, by the length they are the same, I did not measure them.</p>
               <p>Then how can you swear to the length? - The prisoner told me the length.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they of the same quality and sort? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How often do you take an account of your stock? - Once a year.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I humbly submit to you, here is no evidence to put the prisoner on her defence, the property is not proved, that these are the same laces that were given to Mrs. Samuel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. He has spoken as much to the property, as a person can do to property of that nature, Pennington swore, she sold some lace which she received of the prisoner to Mrs. Samuel, she demanded that lace of Mrs. Samuel, and received it back again; therefore, if there is any charm, it is in Mrs. Samuel; therefore, it is still a matter of fact, of which the Jury are to be satisfied, whether it is the same lace.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I submit that the evidence goes to prove a receiver if it proves anything.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. No, the prisoner first of all tempted the girl to take the lace, and the prisoner herself stands in the garden at the time, and receives it from her out of the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. De Charmae , how long had the prisoner lived with you? - Eight months, and we took her to be very honest.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a very good character.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for sometime, and returned with a verdict</p>

H. on one side, and J.

               <p>How comes it there is no tobacco in this indictment? - Because it was found in the street; there was some soap without a mark, common yellow soap, not in the sack; the prisoner was in the house when I found these things.</p>

               <p>Who brought it, will you swear upon your oath, and at the risk of being prosecuted for perjury, that you do not know? - It had been there sometime .</p>
               <p>Do you or do you not know who brought the tabacco?</p>
               <p>Jury. How old are you? - Near nineteen.</p>
               <p>Then answer the question directly! - Not particularly, I cannot say, I know my master buys some sometimes, I do not know who brought that, that was in the house, I only had to cut it, I do not know particularly who brought it.</p>
               <p>Do you know or do you not, once more? - My master bought some of a man at Wapping , I believe that was amongst it.</p>
               <p>Now, who was the man? - I know he lives in Wapping.</p>

               <p>Do you know his name? - His name is Forlyth.</p>

               <p>I am a house-man in the watch-house of St. John's, Wapping; as I was sitting at the watch house door at two in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming by with a load, and I detained him; he said he was going home; he said he had a bit of soap in a bag, there was nothing else; I did not examine him any further.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was headborough of the night, the 2d of June, on my return, I found the prisoner stopped with some soap, which he said he had brought from board a vessel, I believe he said a French vessel, I removed him to our lower town watch-house, and in going along, I observed something bulky in his coat pockets; I searched him, and in each of the pockets of his coat I found an apron, which the prosecutor's wife swore to the next morning, I took him to the office; the King's Arms is opposite to it; he said he had the aprons from the same place where he had the soap, on board the ship; this soap, and the apron, and the bag of tobacco, another watchman had stopped another man with a bag of tobacco on his back, and the other man who had it ran away.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me look at the two aprons before I examine the woman.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Beaumont. Did you see any of the things afterwards that the constable found on this prisoner? - I saw them at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of them? - Nothing but the two aprons; one was a very dirty check apron, a little daubed with red paint; the other was a rough-dry white apron, which was full of iron-moulds, which I had folded up and hung over a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290049"/> chair; here is the fellow apron to the check, the coloured apron has no mark, but diaper tape at the top, and seamed up the middle with blue thread, I seamed it myself, I can speak to it being my own work.</p>
               <p>(The aprons deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You told me twice, it had no mark.</p>
               <p>Court. If it has a mark, what is the mark ? - I cannot say, I have had it these dozen years; I think one mark is an M; I am not sure, the aprons I bought out of pawn, and I cannot say, it is such a quantity of years.</p>
               <p>Is this an M? - No, it is not, I have one that has an M. it is a very old apron.</p>
               <p>Court. But if you have had it so long you must have taken notice of it? - I know it by the iron-moulds, and being rough-dried; I can swear to my own work, I darned it myself .</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now about this same blue apron, is that an old one? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not twenty women sew check aprons with blue thread? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Now is this said draper tape a curiosity? - It is very dear, it is not extravagant, they last so much longer.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

I got up and looked through my window, I saw nobody at first, but the third time I looked the prisoner was dragging a piece of lead out of the gutter into my yard, I saw him standing on a bench, then I saw him stamp upon it to bend it together; I did not see him separate the lead, I got up twice, but could not see him, there was 56 lb. of lead, it came undoubtedly from the gutter, the prisoner seeing me stooped down, I said to him, are you a plumber at work here? and he ran away; I pursued him, I never lost sight of him; I am sure he is the man, some more lead had been taken out of the gutter, it had not been repaired ; I sent the lead to Mr. Blakey, the lead answered to the gutter exactly, I measured it.</p>

               <p>- NICHOLSON sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Sheldon came in first, and not two minutes after the other prisoner followed her, I thought they did not belong to each other, Sheldon asked to look at some handkerchiefs, I took down considerable quantities , I do not know how many; the other came in before I shewed her the handkerchiefs, and sat down about two yards from Sheldon, close to the wall, where three or four whole pieces of cotton lay; Sheldon was difficult in being pleased with the handkerchiefs, it was some time before we could agree, and I was obliged to attend some other customers that wanted flannel, when I came back, I sold her two handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop with you? - Only Mrs. Gibson, at that time, in the course of selling the handkerchiefs the two prisoners talked to each other, and became acquainted, which I was rather surprised at, and she asked to look at some muslin for a cap border, I shewed her some, I counted the quantity as I laid them down by her, there were eight quantities, she seemed very difficult, and we parted, she only wanted one-eighth of a yard, and when they were going out, I counted the quantities of muslin and there were only seven, the little one called the other Mrs. Cooke, and they talked as knowing one another, they went to the door together, and the little one Williams went out first, and made off as fast as she could, the other followed her, but as she was going out I missed the muslin; I says to Mrs. Gibson, you must take care Madam, these people have stole a piece of muslin, and I went after her to the next door and stopped her, and took her into that shop, I told them to take care of her till I came back; I overtook the other about fifty yards off, she was going through a passage, and making off as fast as she could, I brought her back, as soon as ever I brought Williams in, she dropped a piece of cotton below her cloak, she stooped down against some glass and things in the shop, and dropped it, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>What did you find under her cloak where she dropped it? - It was my cotton, it was my mark upon it, the officer was sent for, and the book muslin was found inside Williams's petticoat at the upper part; upon the other prisoner there were two parcels of handkerchiefs, those I found in Mr. Holmes's shop close by her; they begged for mercy, and acknowledged themselves guilty, there was no promise of favour, I am very sure of that.</p>
               <p>Did you see them take any thing? - No, I did not know or perceive that they had taken anything.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you never said, that you saw them take anything? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did you never say that you had laid a trap for them and had caught them? - No, the reason I had to take them, I missed the piece of muslin by the number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This is a charge against the prisoners for stealing all these things; It has been held over and over again that two persons cannot do this , in the first place the prisoner Williams is proved by this witness to be in a situation where she might steal cotton, the other where she could muslin, neither of them in situations where they could steal the others.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you mention any circumstance where it has been so held; as to your first objection, I am at the same time aware that there have been cases where two persons have been guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. In stealing from the person, but not the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Nicholson. Recollect and tell us, whether the next morning after the loss of these goods, you did not say you had observed these things taken, but you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290051"/> was advised not to say so, that it might be a capital offence? - No, Sir, I am sure I did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Greenow's Council. Pray who pays the expences of this prosecution ? - Billings is to pay it, he paid for the bill being found, we paid our own expences, and the prosecutor paid us.</p>
               <p>Have you settled what share of the reward you are to have if it goes on? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. When you was before the Justice, you did not say that you found the money in Richardson's pocket? - I said, the money was in his pocket, and in searching his pocket it dropped on the ground, when I put my hand into Richardson's pocket I found some halfpence.</p>
               <p>(The money produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was two pence halfpenny and a farthing, or three pence and a farthing in copper, and there was one halfpenny bent both ways, it was rather crooked, I cannot swear to the halfpence, they look to be my halfpence, and the sixpence looks to be the same.</p>
               <p>Court. You said nothing about the sixpence at first.</p>

               <p>I was the officer of the night, I was going my rounds with the patrol, we met the prosecutor, he said, he had been robbed by two men, one of them had a bundle with something in a handkerchief; we followed them down the next street , I thought I heard them, and we went up the street as fast as we could go, they were standing against a wall; I laid hold of them, one of them who had a bundle, and the patrol searched them while I held them, and puting his hand in his pocket the money fell down on the flag-stones.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, both the prisoners must be acquitted, the point of law goes to the acquittal of both of them; for the boy says, when they came up, they accosted him in an insolent way, and they asked him for his money, but when he said he had but two pence halfpenny or three pence, one of them said, do not take that; therefore, supposing two men attacking a man with intent to rob him, if one repents in the moment, if the other man takes the money yet it will be no crime in him who changes his mind, but, says the prosecutor, which it was that took my money I cannot tell: this is like a case from Ipswich, where five men were indicted for murder, and it appeared upon a special verdict, that it was murder in one, but not the other four, and the Jury had no evidence which committed the blow, and says t he Court, if you cannot positively fix by evidence which is the man that is guilty, we cannot punish any one: besides, in this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290053"/> case, the boy was pointedly examined about the sixpence, and said nothing of it at first, and after that it is material for the sake of justice that you should not suffer him to mend his evidence in so essential a point as the property which was lost, and he expressly said at first that he lost only twopence half-penny.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday last but one, I was going on some business to Bloomsbury, when I was past the end of Fleet-market, about twenty or thirty yards above Fleet-market, I saw the boy which since proves to be Mr. Hunt's boy, coming down the flag pavement with a parcel on his head, I saw the prisoner in the horse-way, the first I saw of him was about three yards distance from the boy with the parcel, he was running, he came to the boy and put his hand to the parcel, I thought he was going to wrong the boy of the parcel, because I have heard of many such instances, the boy stood on the flag pavement, and to the best of my knowledge the prisoner had one foot on the kirb stone, and the other on the horse-way, I stepped between them, the prisoner had his head rather stooping down, I saw him with a shilling in his hand, and I saw him put the shilling in the boy's hand, and heard him say to him make haste, he then had the parcel under his arm, the prisoner said Mr. Wilson sent him, I asked the boy who that Mr. Wilson was, the prisoner answered, he lives in Castle-yard, Holborn; and the boy in the mean time laid hold of the parcel he had under his arm, and he let him have it, the prisoner agreed to go to Mr. Wilson, the boy put a question, did Mr. Wilson send you? the prisoner said, yes, the boy said that could not be for he was not at home, he said Mrs. Wilson sent him, that was the same thing, or words to that purport, the prisoner made many excuses not to go to Mr. Wilson's; one of us knocked at the door, the prisoner began, I spoke and the boy spoke, so there was such a confusion, that I believe Mrs. Wilson did not understand it at first, she said, the parcel was safe, and thought it better to let the man go; I took the prisoner to Mr. Hunt's, and related the affair there; the parcel was left in the care of Mrs. Wilson.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I desire to stop in the street to speak to anybody on the other side of the way? - I cannot positively answer that question, he did mention something about a friend.</p>

               <p>Did you live upon terms of intimacy with her? - The woman was agreeable.</p>
               <p>How happened you to be in this familiar way, drinking with a woman whom you charged with being a thief? - It was needless for me to think anything of a pint of beer.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you open the door yourself? - I broke it open myself I tell you, the Thursday after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Did you ask her for any money to make it up? - The day before she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290059"/> brought to the magistrate again to be fully committed, I would have made it up that night for the exact money the sheets cost me.</p>

            ; we went to his lodgings, they were shut up, it was two in the morning, he wanted to go into the Red Horse in 'Change-court, we would not let him stay there, we desired him to go with us as far as Drury-lane, and he should receive no hurt; we went up Drury-lane, and saw the watchmen on their duty, and returning back by Martlet-court, we met two women , and they asked the man, would he give them any thing to drink, and he said he did not care; he asked them where they would go, they said over the way; I said they should not go into any house, and he gave my partner a shilling to fetch a quartern of peppermint for them, and a quartern of gin for me and my partner and when my partner came back he gave him the change, and my partner went home with him when the liquor was drank, and we were talking together, and this prisoner and the prosecutor went down the court about three or four yards from us, and the woman that was along with her said, let the man alone, for he is under the care of the patrol, but my partner looked back and saw the woman by the wall put her hand in his pocket, and my partner said, you wicked woman are you going to rob the man before my face, and he run and laid hold of her, and I took seven shillings and six-pence out of her hand, and six-pence dropped; and she said I was going to rob her, for it was her own property.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, a good many years.</p>
               <p>Do you know her companion? - Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>What are they? - They are girls of the town.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, do you think you discharge your duty in suffering a man that is under your protection to be picked up by women of the town, and to stop and drink in the street at two o'clock in the morning? - It was between three and four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Does that mend the matter? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Is that the way in which you usually discharge your duty, and preserve the peace of the town, do you make a common practice of that? - No Sir, we do not indeed, we thought no harm in it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a patrol, and have been so three years.</p>
               <p>You are the gentleman who went with money from the man under your care to fetch liquors for the women of the town? - We were coming up at two in the morning from the Strand, the watchman had got hold of a man for robbing the prosecutor, he gave me a shilling, and I went over and fetched the liquors, and brought the change to him, I was turning round and the other woman said to the prisoner , that is too bad before the patrols; I ran up to her, and caught her hand out of his pocket, she wanted to get her hand down.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not wonder at women's robbing men before your faces, if you suffer them to pick up men in this manner? - There was no picking up, we did not suffer them to go out of our sight.</p>
               <p>So that the disorders that are committed within your sight are all proper, they shall be enquired into.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They attacked us about three in the morning, and the man went to fetch the liquor, the gentleman asked me to go with him to the place, I said I did not like to go, the other patrol said he did not like to go, so he took me and pulled me three or four yards down, he was in liquor; he said, I want to give them the bag, and the patrol said, damn your blood, what do you want to pick the man's pocket, I have owed it you a long time; the prosecutor would not go to maintain the charge, he counted his money over, and declared he had not lost a half-penny; two gentlemen of St. Martin's parish came up and said, why take the girl to the watch-house, she is not guilty; they said, damn your bloods, I suppose you are parties concerned, we will charge you, which they did, they found they were parishioners of St. Martin's parish, and they begged their pardon; Dorrington had been at No. 10, in Bennet's Court, and he wanted a guinea and a half to make the affair up.</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I am as innocent of this as God is in Heaven.</p>
               <p>WINEFRED MARGATE sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw Dorrington the patrol last Monday at No. 10, in Bennet's Court, Drury-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290063"/> he asked if the friends of this young woman could make up one guinea and a half, he would make up this affair, and would not appear against her, this is the man.</p>
               <p>Who else was present? - There was another woman, but she is very ill, and could not come.</p>
               <p>What is that other woman's name? -

               <p>Dorrington. On Saturday last I was down at Guildhall, Westminster, we had several trials, one concerning this man, it was this Mrs . Lawless that was with the prisoner, and told her not to rob the man; she was down at Westminster, and we went to have something to drink; I went to her house to let her know when the recognizances were to be withdrawn, and she said what can we do concerning this matter of Het Davis that is in prison now, says I, I can do nothing in it; says she I will give you a guinea, that will be half a guinea a piece, says I, I cannot make it up, I dare say the prosecutor will not hurt you, that was all I said; I could not stand and see that man robbed. I can bring people to my character, here is one of the beadles here if you please to call him.</p>
               <p>Court. Your conduct sufficiently speaks your character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to her character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's Council. There was some silk in the woman's apron when she came in? - No, I saw her take the silk and slip it under her apron.</p>
               <p>Was not she dealing with you for silk, and going to buy it of you? - It was not the silk that I served her with, it was other silk, and nothing like the pattern; it was put by way of concealment; she only wanted a single skein, and here is near two pounds.</p>

               <p>On Monday evening the 16th of May, Mr. Worral and myself had been at Ranelagh, and about two in the morning we were in <placeName id="t17850629-59-crimeloc284">Duke-street, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</placeName>

               <p>What sort of light was it? - There was light, the day was breaking, there was sufficient light to discern every part of his dress; I have his face as strong in my recollection as any friend I may happen to know; I did not see Champness till the day after, at the bar of the Bow-street Office , he was in company with others; I believe he came and surrendered himself, hearing that the Magistrates had sent for him , he came to know what they wanted with him; I mentioned that he was the very man before the Magistrate, and I believe Lord Westmoreland and another gentleman that were there heard it; I should suppose that they were a minute or a minute and an half with me, or possibly more; I was somewhat intimidated, and could not get my watch immediately out, and they were very quiet, and did not swear or anything of that kind.</p>
               <p>Court. You say this passed in a minute or a minute and an half, and you was in a hurry, and this was two o'clock, and yet you can venture to swear to him? - I am very confident of him, I feel the unhappy circumstance, I knew him when he came into court, he is the only man I swear to; he had a whitish waistcoat, and a light coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the hand, when you was at the Justice's? - I did, immediately as I got home I mentioned the circumstance.</p>
               <p>When you saw him at Bow-street did you observe his hand ? - Immediately, my Lord, it was in his pocket, it was covered with a handkerchief, it appeared as it did the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This I see was a very short transaction, so short that you had not an opportunity of observing whether it was a pistol, or a cutlass, or a stick? I observed either a pistol, or cutlass, or something, I had hold of a thing which appeared to me like a pistol, and I put it aside.</p>
               <p>You was somewhat intimidated? - I confess I was.</p>
               <p>So much intimidated that you do not know exactly to whom you gave your money, and to whom you gave your watch? - I know this, that I either gave my money or my watch into the hand that had the wound; I can only swear to one guinea; I never saw the prisoner before, there was something tied over the hand; I do not know whether there was a thumb-stall or not.</p>
               <p>The man came to Bow-street voluntarily? - So I was told; he immediately came to the bar; he said that the officer had been enquiring at his house for him, and therefore he walked up; he was with seven or eight at the bar.</p>
               <p>He was shewn to you as a person that had surrendered himself, knowing that enquiries had been made after him? - No, he was not, I saw the faces of four or five.</p>
               <p>Who was under examination at that time? - I believe the man in the green coat was at the bar at that time.</p>
               <p>Who was in the coach with you? - Mr. Worrall, and a Mr. Hall.</p>
               <p>I should suppose they had the same opportunity of observing the prisoner that you had? - I was next the door myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever see your watch afterwards? - No, I never did.</p>

               <p>- WORRALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I do not swear to either of the men, I only know in general of the robbery.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of May the prisoners were discharged from Sir Sampson's, and the lusty man, Champness had a handkerchief round his hand at that time; this gentleman came on the 17th, to give information.</p>
               <p>This man came to the office of his own accord, did he not? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Jury to Read. Do you know anything of the other prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER CHAMPNESS'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I leave it to my councel intirely; I hope my surrendering myself is sufficient that I was innocent.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you charge him before you saw his hand? - Before I saw his hand I mentioned it to several persons round.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Champness. I confess I had something round my hand; it had been cut; there was not a single person at the bar when I surrendered myself but this young man.</p>

               <p>Are you sure now that Morris is one of the men? - I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>What became of the soldier? - On Sunday morning the 19th a little before seven o'clock, I met him, I had Morris in the watch-house before eleven the same night, he told the serjeant he had been with his girl to Piccadilly, and he had got the dirt in the kennel, the officer said it was impossible; when the gloves were found on him, I said them are my gloves, and he immediately said good God, they are my gloves! The Sunday after I was going out of my own house, and this soldier was going up Duke-street, St. James's, and I was going along Bury-street, I thought he was the man that robbed me, I hastened up to him, he crossed opposite the church, and pretended to look at the clock, I thought if he went up the church yard, I would go up the court just by, and I followed him into Piccadilly, and I collared him, he said, he was innocent, I called for a watchman, and took him to a constable in Jermyne-street , this was about seven on Sunday morning; he was not searched then; on the Monday morning at Litchfield-street, the Magistrate asked me if I could swear to him, I told him I was clear he was the man, but I was conscientious in swearing to him, unless there was property found on him; the Magistrate ordered his quarters to be searched, I desired the constable to take notice of an old white handkerchief, and I went with them, and the very first thing that was found was the handkerchief, and a pistol was found under his bed, it was where he was quartered.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - A man pointed it out.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner himself asked where his lodgings were? - Yes, I believe he told where.</p>

               <p>Do you know the two men now? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you seen either of these men since? - I cannot be positive, I cannot swear these are the men that robbed him, I cannot say that, I never saw them, I did not know them at that time.</p>
               <p>Do you know them now? - I cannot say I should know if I was to see them; nor I am not positive, I should know the gentleman if I was to see him, for I never saw him before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Morris. This Diamond cannot deny that he received five shillings from the prosecutor the night before on centry? - I am not positive that was the gentleman, I was centry the night before, and there was a gentleman came along and gave me five shillings, but I am not positive that it was this gentleman.</p>
               <p>Blacketer. This man said, he was in the same company with Guthrie; I met the serjeant, and asked him if he had three men in his company, one named Diamond, and another Guthrie, he said, yes, I went to this Diamond's quarters, and searched his lodgings.</p>

               <p>My fellow partner that is now at the bar and me, catched these two men in a very undecent sort of manner, so my comrade ran up to him, and told him he was worse than the beasts in the field; the prosecutor told him he would give him all that he had if I would not take him to the watch-house; he gave him his gloves, and shoved that old handkerchief into my hand, the other made his escape; as for the pistol which he says was presented to him, I had from the witness here that night, I had a short jacket on which I usually work in, and I thought I should drop it, I held it in my hand, it had no cock to it, and had none for twenty-four hours after I received the pistol; after we got the property we made up the Park as far as the Mint, this witness that is here now, came and received the watch of my fellow criminal, and he went and crossed over by the Mint, and came down by Tyburn turnpike, there was some person from the toll-house called out, if they saw a man in a white frock, I went home, I heard the next morning that my fellow prisoner was taken up, I went from thence to

               <p>Prisoner Guthrie to Diamond. Did not you tell the watch? - I never saw the watch, I have had no watch but my own for these two years and a half, and that I brought out of my country, I never had a pistol in my possession in my life, I never had anything but a fuzee of the serjeant's and colonel's to clean.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Guthrie. Whether this man who is now witness, in either respect I think he stands, only let him say whether or not, he did not go on the Friday and take this watch to sell it to a Jew in Westminster.</p>

               <p>How long did you stay there? - I only just went within the gate and returned again, and was coming home across the park.</p>
               <p>Was you in St. James's-park that evening? - No, nor that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Morris. So help me God, them men were in the grove, and went from thence to Hyde-park.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Guthrie.

               <p>Prisoner Morris. He bears a very bad character by all report.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe I can have a character from the gentleman whom I had the honour to serve, and a very good one; I left him because I have been to learn to dress ladies and gentlemen's hair, and he did not want a servant.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, to this crime there is a very serious defence set up, and as gross and as scandalous a reflection on the prosecutor as men could throw out; if the prosecutor appeared to be a man addicted to such abominable practices as they attribute to him, it would go to affect his credit; however, they charge him directly with being in a most indecent situation with another man, and that he gave them these things to make his peace; but then they have proved that by a witness, with respect to whom it is not necessary there should be anything further to blast his character and credit than his own testimony, for he tells you out of his own mouth, that his conduct was so scandalous, that the night before he took five shillings from some man as a consideration for such abominable practices, so that he has proved himself to be a worthless, profligate fellow, and deserves no credit; if you credit the prosecutor, the defence of the prisoners makes their case much worse, and if they extorted money from him under the idea of such a crime as this, it does not excuse them.</p>

               <p>EWEN BAILEY, Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>Early in June, 1784, I had in my possession returning from India, diamonds and pearls to a certain amount, which were shewn to a broker, Mr. Sharpe, for the purpose of being disposed of in the usual course of business some time had elapsed when a person was brought in order to purchase those diamonds, I think it was a Mr. Randall, he was brought by Mr. Sharpe, and upon examining these diamonds, this Mr. Randall found a deficiency from the original invoice, Mr. Randall and Mr. Sharpe ascertained the quantity that were taken out by comparing with the invoice, and Mr. Sharp sold the pearls to Mr. Randall, not supposing as I believe, or not knowing, or not suspecting that there was any robbery committed on them; the pearls were sold according to the invoice, and the diamonds according to the deduction of the ascertained number of the stones that were taken out; Mr. Sharpe acquainted my agent sometime after (I was not in town myself.) that upon Mr. Randall's having sold these pearls to a certain person there appeared a deficiency in the pearls, Mr. Sharpe advertised these pearls and diamonds, and circulated hand-bills in the usual form, these produced no discovery; I could not at that time fix the robbery on any particular person: in the course of last month I was going out of town, and I took from my finger a diamond ring that was made by Gray in Bond-street, and put it in one of my lodgings in a drawer, the house is in St. Alban's-street, No. 11, the house of Narcissa Marskall; I lodged there when the former things were stolen, the prisoner was my servant, and had been so during the whole time, he had lived a little more than twelve months with me at this time; and he had formerly lived in my service: upon my return to town I looked for this ring and could not find it, I think I was absent ten days, the prisoner was not with me, I left him in town, I left it in a drawer in a mahogany box and the box was locked up, I had the key; I enquired of my servant, who denied having seen it or knowing anything of it; when I returned the box was locked as I left it; I could not arrive at any knowledge of this ring, and it then struck me very forcibly that this servant must be privy to it, and I recollected having seen in the same box two sapphire rings, and a gold stock-buckle, and they were missing also; that confirmed me in the idea of the prisoner's dishonesty; I then came into a resolution of quitting everybody that was about me, from the discomfort of having a thief about me, I quitted my lodgings and went into a house of my own, and the prisoner was the only person I took with me; I mentioned the circumstance to the gentlemen at the Rotation-office , and they sent to search his boxes, I was present at the search, and in searching his baggage there was found that ring, made by Mr. Gray, the stones of an antique ring that belonged to me also, and two handkerchiefs with my name; the ring made by Mr. Gray was a hair ring set with diamonds of a particular form, the sapphire rings and the gold stock-buckle are accounted for, but not found.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Councel for the Prosecution. After he was taken into custody were there any promises made to him, that it would be better for him if he would say anything on the subject? - I sent to him, and told him my determination to quit everybody that I had about me, and that it was necessary to recommend him to the next service, that he should undergo a search that my mind might be convinced; I advised him to make a full discovery, which he did not.</p>
               <p>- DIXON sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to search this house, and found this ring; I was searching the drawers in the room where the prisoner lay, and just as I came to the drawer where the ring was, he went down on his knees, and said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290073"/> would shew where it was; and I found it in a powder bag, mixed with the powder; it was in the case just as it is now; I found the stones of a ring, and these two handkerchiefs; here is the antique; and I found two keys in one of his breeches pockets in the drawer, which opens two of the Major's boxes, I tried them, and the Major tried them, these picklock keys opened the boxes as easy as the Major's keys.</p>
               <p>(The diamond ring deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This ring I purchased of Mr. Gray in Bond-street; I am clear it is the same, the form of the ring is particular, I have no doubt of its being mine from the hair in the inside; it was made by my particular directions; this is the stone of a ring that I wore, when I lost it it was set; I have had it several years, I have no doubt of this being the same; I examined the keys that were found, they opened and shut the boxes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. This property must have been found out in consequence of the confession .</p>
               <p>Court. It strikes me from the evidence Mr. Bailey gave at the outset, that it will be extremely difficult, perhaps ultimately so, to identify these diamonds and pearls, the value of the things already produced go far beyond the mark the law fixes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I wish to call Mr. Grant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. With submission, whatever comes to you, is in consequence of the confession of this boy.</p>
               <p>Court. Unsuspected and voluntary consession are the best evidence against offenders, and it is from the apprehension that promises of favour or threats might induce a man of a weak mind, like torture in some countries, in order to obtain the benefit of those promises, or to escape those threats, to make a confession that was not wholly true; but that can never go to the rejection of the evidence of other witnesses which is got at in consequence of that confession, as the law is clearly settled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. The examination of Mr. Grant is for the purpose of supporting out of his own mouth, an action against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have no difficulty in stating what my purpose is, independent of any action, I think it my duty that he should be examined.</p>
               <p>Court. Had it been wholly immaterial, I dare say you would not have desired to add less evidence to the stronger, and the resistance to it would decide me in receiving the evidence, if I had no other motive.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Court. Is there any other evidence to this property, not out of Mr. Grant's mouth?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There are, but they are not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grant. My book shews the sum of money, but there is no quantity; my man corroborates the circumstance, but he is not here.</p>
               <p>Then it rests upon the memory of you and your man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that the usual course of your business? - I seldom buy pearls, I do not deal much in them.</p>
               <p>Do you frequently buy diamonds in the rough state? - Not very often, I cannot say that I bought any others, I believe not.</p>
               <p>How many strings of pearls might you buy besides these? - I have bought diamonds ready wrought, and strings of pearls; I really cannot say, but I believe half a dozen or a dozen in that state.</p>
               <p>Did you consider the ten pounds as the full value of the pearls upon your oath? - I sold them for thirteen pounds, I sold them to different people.</p>
               <p>When did you sell them? - Immediately after, I do not buy these things to keep by me.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Grant. Did you ask these persons any questions how they came by these pearls and diamonds? - They said they brought them over from India; they said they lodged in the Haymarket, and were dealers, they did not say they were servants.</p>
               <p>Did you suppose them to be merchants that had come over from India to dispose of their property? - If I had had the least suspicion I should not have bought them, I had no suspicion of them; I have stopped things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Were not the things left at your house for some time? - Eight or ten days; I did not buy them rashly at the first coming, I thought they had been all over the trade, I sent my man to enquire whether they lodged there, because one of them was about buying a gold watch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What is your profession? - A diamond broker, I saw a parcel of pearls, out of which Mr. Bailey missed some. Mr. Bailey first produced me the invoice of diamonds, by India weights; on opening them and shewing them, I found them once exactly agreeable to the invoice, the pearls I counted and weighed myself, and when I first saw them they tallied exactly with the invoice; after this I returned them to Mr. Bailey; I had the pearls five or six days, we did not agree on the purchase of them, and I returned them to him.</p>
               <p>What quantity of pearls were missing when you had them the second time?</p>

               <p>Mr. Sharpe. I found, that instead of weighing twenty-six carats, they only weighed twenty-three the second time; the deficiency of diamonds was one hundred; the pearls I valued at 600 l. Mr. Rumbold bought them at 550 l. clear of all deductions; and according to the 600 l. the proportion of pearls that were taken were worth 41 l. 14 s.</p>

               <p>Should you know the men again? - No, I know so far as to their stature , but I never swore to the men. I have a suspicion that these are the men, I can swear to the marks and colour of the boat and the clothes of the men, but not to the men's persons; the colour of the boat was the inside painted green, almost new apparently to me, and the sculls painted lead colour.</p>

               <p>Court. Was there any search made for these things? - Yes, I understood they did, they were thrown out below watermark; my boat was painted green, and black oars, and the lower part of my boat was red, below water-mark.</p>

               <p>Jury. You did not see him enter in at the door? - No, Sir, I turned round my head and saw him there; I missed a card of lace, there was a vacancy, I immediately pursued him, he had got to the next shop window, I followed him from New Turnstile , ours is the third shop from New Turnstile , he looked behind him and saw me run, and he set off and ran as fast as he could, I called out stop thief, and the neighbours ran, some coachmakers, and I then lost sight of him down Gate-street, and I returned to the shop, and a man came immediately and said the boy was taken, and the lace was found; I went immediately into Lincoln's-Inn Fields and saw the prisoner, and knew him again, I am confident it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Was there any other person but the prisoner when you saw him in the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Describe a little the situation of the shop to that part from whence the lace was taken? - He must come in the shop to take the lace.</p>
               <p>So that sitting in that situation, if I understand you, you saw him draw the lace? - No, he was shuffling in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. She did not know that anything was gone, she saw nothing taken, her impression at the time was this, that he wanted to match something, it is the actual taking constitutes the felony, she had no idea that he had got anything of her's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I take it that it is not at all necessary that you should see the actual thing taken, if you see the act of taking, in so penal a case as this is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. It must be left to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In a case where a man said, I felt the act of pulsation in my fob, it was so held.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. But here he had got possession of the thing at the time that she first saw him, her first conception was, that he had something to match.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the only question is, whether he did or did not take it privately, the distinction has been, whether they take so as nobody sees them at the time they actually commit the theft, or whether they are discovered in the act of the theft; here the boy was in the shop before she saw him, and he was fumbling in his pocket; if he had before that time got possession of the lace, the felony is compleat; if you think then the boy was in the act of taking it, it does not amount to taking privately.</p>

               <p>Had you heard any noise like the breaking open any places before you went out at seven? - I had been ill in bed, and I had business to go out upon.</p>
               <p>How near was your apartment to her's? - Mine is in the parlour, and the lady's is up two pair of stairs, I returned at eleven, and I did not find the prisoner at home; I did not go up stairs till Miss M'Farlen called me, I saw her first at the street door, or in my apartment which is the parlour, I did not let her in.</p>
               <p>When she came in, did you tell her any thing about the state of her apartment? - I did not know anything till she called me up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner come home again that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you first see him again? - After he was in custody.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed when he was in custody? - In a green coat.</p>
               <p>Had he anything new on? - Not that I perceived, I heard that he had new things on.</p>
               <p>Had you seen any of those things which he had on when he was in custody, before this robbery, upon your oath? - Not to my knowledge, that is all I know about it, the prosecutrix said, if the prisoner would give up the property, she would drop the prosecution, and my father and me, and two or three more went down to Tothill-fields.</p>

               <p>Coming along Whitechapel, I met Jones, and there were four more men walking along, I passed by them, and I heard one say to the other, I do not like that man, I believe he has smuggled liquor, I turned round and saw the four men make up to him, and I went up and spoke to him, and asked him what was the matter; they said it was smuggled liquor, then I was going away, and the liquor flew off his head, he called stop thief after me, and I said for what, he said I threw it off his head .</p>
               <p>Jones. I take my oath that the prisoner is the man that took me by the collar, I saw them at a distance laughing and all playing the rogue together, this man was along with the other four, they were all in one company, they all came up to me together; the prisoner took me by the collar, and said, he and another in a blue coat were custom-house officers.</p>

               <p>Where was you from five to ten? - I was in my bar minding my business; I went to put my little boy to bed, I have two doors to my room, I unlocked one, and the moment I went into my room, I found the other door was broke open, I found a parcel of rags, which I call patches, laying about in my room, which had been moved and the work bag taken; I catched the prisoner myself in the street, because he bore a very bad character, and he lodged in my house for a week, and I did not intend to let him lodge there longer, he said himself he was in; nobody saw him there, but I know it must have been him; I had not seen him since he came in, I saw the shift laying on the bed, and a pair of large scissars laying on the bed; I broke his room door open myself, I called first and nobody answered, but the scissars were fetched away, and the thread was left behind, I told him he should not lodge any longer without he paid me a week's lodging, and he had no money; I did not see him till I took him up, the 6th of June was on a Monday, and on the Tuesday morning, met him in Charlotte-street , I laid hold of his collar, says I, you dog, you have robbed me, says he, if you will not send for a constable, I will tell you where your things are, and give you part of the money, and send for my uncle; he said, if I sent for a constable he was sure to be done, I sent for a constable, the minute I went into the house, and I sent for a coach, and he told me he had sold all the things to Mrs. Brown in Fleet-lane, for six shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290094"/> he told me he bought a silk handkerchief for two shillings, and he had but four shillings, I went to Mrs. Brown, and she flew in a great passion, and said, she had no such things in her house, and never saw the boy, I fetched the prisoner to Mrs. Brown's, she denied having anything, pho, pho, says he, you know I sold you them last night, and yo u put me out, and there was a boy that was born with a double chin; in searching him there was a part of a silver locket found in his pocket, which I had in my hand that very day; I put them together as old silver, thinking to sell them the next day, to buy my child a frock, he gave the constable three guineas and a half, as part of my money, and said he would send for his uncle to make up the rest, the constable has the money, I got none of the things of Mrs. Brown, the Justice gave him from Tuesday till Friday to consider who had them, and on Wednesday he told me he sold them to Mrs. Brown; he said he went to his girl in Newtoner's-lane , but she was gone to live with another man, I asked him how he came to break the lock of my door, and he said nobody saw him do it, if he did do it.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, the prosecutrix took the prisoner to the public house in Bedford Square, and sent for me, accordingly I took charge of him, he soon confessed the whole in going to the Justice's, he said, he would restore it as already related, and what money he had about him he would restore again, then he gave me that money.</p>
               <p>Were any promises or threats made use of to make the prisoner confess? - She promised that she would not take him to the Justice if he would confess.</p>
               <p>Was that before he confessed anything? - Yes, I searched him at Justice Blackborough's, and took from him a part of a silver locket, and a pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>(The locket deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have had it for some years, I said, if he would restore all my things again, I would not carry him to the Justice, for it would be the ruin of me, as I had nobody at home, and had two young children, I could not spare time to attend him here; I said if he would restore all my property again.</p>

               <p>In what manner did he take these things from you? - I begged him to let my cloak alone, and I endeavoured to hold my cloak, and the other held a knife to my throat, then I let my cloak go; then they told me to go along about my business, and not follow them; I stood still and let them go, and then I was going to follow them, there being a public house near, and the other turned round with his knife, and swore he would run me through if I followed them; I did not go on then, I let them go off; I went to No. 8, in little Mary-le-bon-street, to a friend's house, and told them I was robbed.</p>

               <p>Was it before or after ten? - The watchman had just gone ten.</p>
               <p>Had you light enough to distinguish the features of the persons that robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it after that the prisoners were taken? - The next day, one at four o'clock, the other at eight in the afternoon, I saw them the next day? I described them to the watchmen, and they went round to search for them, and saw them at a public house where they robbed me, not twenty yards off, there were fourteen or fifteen of them in company altogether, and I picked out the prisoners, I knew them perfectly well; I am now quite sure these are the two; I never saw them before the robbery, but I have no doubt but they are the persons; my cloak was never found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutrix said at the Justice's she did not know which of us it was that took out the knife.</p>

               <p>After I had cried ten on Wednesday the 29th of June, this woman came by my box crying, and the postman asked her the cause, she said two men were laying in the field, and they had robbed her, I went up and she told me the same, then I went and called my partner; she described them, and we went to search for them, we guessed partly who they were, the next day we went again, and she described them in the same manner again, and we went and took her to a house where these people resort.</p>
               <p>What house is that? - At the bottom of High-street, there is a skittle-ground , the man's name is Dickinson, there were about a dozen of them there, and she knew them when she came up, and before she came within a hundred yards she said them were the very men that attacked her the night before.</p>
               <p>Did she hesitate which it was? - Not a word, she fixed upon the two directly, I found a knife with two blades upon him, a common knife.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The knife that was put to me was a smallish knife, and much such a knife as that.</p>

             the watchman, and he told me of this robbery, the next day we went in pursuit and took the two prisoners, by the description the young woman gave us, the young woman went with one of the watchmen, which was Millar, then she saw the two men, and told him they were the two men; he did not think he could attack them both, so we went with him, and we took the prisoners, she was not with us then, I believe she was in a house in Baker street;. Cox was taken first, and the other some time after.</p>
               <p>Who took Cox? - There were Millar, Harry Jones, and I.</p>
               <p>Who took the other? - The other was taken by a man that is at the door, he is son in law to Millar, one of the watchmen; I was not present when the young woman shewed them to Millar ; they were taken some few minutes after.</p>
               <p>- MILLAR sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman , my comrade Jones brought this young woman to me on Wednesday night , and we went together to see if we could see them, but we did not that night; the next day between four and five my comrade told me that there were a great many people in the public house, so I went with the young woman over there, and she shewed them to us, it was between four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290097"/> and five in the afternoon the next day, and she shewed me the two prisoners, they were the outside of the house.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take them then? - I was by myself, and I had nothing in my hands; I am very sure there was nobody with me but the young woman; if I had any assistance I would have taken them immediately.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did you find your comrades to assist you? - My comrades was just on the other side of the chapel, a little distance off us, I went and told them, so they came the back way again; then Cox was there, and Bill was gone away, there were several people with the prisoners, but whether they were in their company I cannot say, there were above a dozen or better.</p>
               <p>How near did you go to them? - Within three or four yards, the young woman and me.</p>
               <p>So that she could see them very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she say anything to you in their hearing? - I cannot tell that they heard it, she told me them were the two lads that robbed her.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. How came you to tell me that you were present when the young woman pointed out to you these prisoners? - I did not tell you I was present; I told you she picked them out.</p>
               <p>You know the prisoner's conviction will be followed by a reward? - I am not beholden to the reward now nor any time, I can do very well without it.</p>
               <p>But you know the fact? - I have very often heard of it.</p>
               <p>Has there nothing of this sort been named now among you? - It has often been particularly mentioned.</p>
               <p>Court to Hoare. How came you not to tell me Millar went first of all to look for this man? - We went to the public house and wanted there till Millar and the young woman went to pick them out.</p>
               <p>Court. That is nothing like your former evidence.</p>

               <p>Court.

            . How long do you remember Harris resorting to that house in George-alley? - Three or four months, M'Glew kept the house before, I had not seen him that morning, the woman prisoner said, she lodged there that night, it was a private house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. Would not these ladies of the town have carried me to that house? - Certainly they would.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. My Lord, I submit whether on this evidence, Harris should be put on his defence, that which is against him expressly, is, that he was found in a situation where these halfpence were found; the indictment specifies that these halfpence naming the number of them, are of a precise value, the same as the farthings, now this man's evidence says, that they were some of them counterfeits.</p>
               <p>The indictment handed up to the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not necessary to prove the value that is lost, if the whole was counterfeit halfpence, they should be so settled to be sure, but I do not conceive that the Court will say, if a part are counterfeit that should vindicate the rest; I do not now speak of the effect of the evidence, but supposing it to be clearly proved under this indictment, that the prisoner had stolen ten good halfpence of the value of five pence, do not you conceive that would be sufficient to maintain the indictment; but, supposing the prisoner had stolen nothing but bad halfpence, I think it would not have been sufficient to maintain the indictment.</p>

               <p>About half after ten the prisoner took a one pair of stairs lodging of mine, ready furnished, he came the night he took it, I never saw any more of him after the second night for ten weeks, he gave me no notice of quitting, after he went away I missed the things in the indictment; I had seen them there, the things were never found again, I never saw them since.</p>
               <p>Did he leave his lodgings locked or open? - Locked, and he took the key away with him; as I was at work I saw him about ten weeks after in the street, and I immediately went to him and seized him in the street.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He said he was not the person, but I am quite positive; I saw him both nights, he came and stood the side of me when I was at work some few minutes; I did not see him by day light before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Councel. How have you described this person and his dress before the Magistrate? - I can tell you the particulars; the first night when he came into the house a fire was lighted for him, he went up in his room, the door I locked myself the last thing in the morning, when I got up to go to market, I found the door open , I saw no more of him till the next night , when I was at work he came in and asked for a candle, and went to bed; the next night when he came, I did not say anything to him; I have other lodgers.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how he was dressed when you apprehended him? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it the same dress in which he first came to you? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Have not you said that he has appeared before the Magistrates in different dresses at different times ? - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you said that he frequently wore boots? - No.</p>
               <p>Several people I believe attended this gentleman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear that he had been a man of great estate in America, which he had lost by his attachment to his country? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Have you not said before the Magistrate that he wore boots and half-boots? - I never did.</p>
               <p>You never found any of your property? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you search his lodgings? - I did not know where.</p>
               <p>Did not you take the trouble to enquire where he lodged ? - I enquired into his character, and I found it a very good character, but I did not think it worth while to enquire after my property ten weeks after.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Mr. Edwards, do you with yourself to say anything.</p>

               <p>Please your Lordship, I never knew the man before he took me, I never was out of my lodgings but one night since I took it, from the 10th of December, to the 15th of April, then the house was given up, and I moved with the people, I now live with them, I used to be with a gentleman that came passenger with me, one Major Ward; I am a gentleman that have a wife and family in America; I came here on my own matters; I was very angry with the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290104"/> that took me , I had a stick in my hand, but I did not use it.</p>

               <p>My partner's name is Adlard Thorp, I lost some printed linen the 16th of June, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner and another woman came in with inten to buy a remnant of cotton for a child's frock, I served the other woman to the amount of five shillings, they went out together, and as they were going out of the door, I suspected there was something under the prisoner's cloak; I told my young man I was not satisfied, and we both went from behind the counter to the door, and the moment we got to her, my young man saw her drop the linen, I did not; I saw the linen on the floor in the shop, they were only just at the door, she made some frivolous excuse, and said, she knew nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive her take anything at all in the shop? - No, it was laying just by the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Council. Your counter is near the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have linen placed in other parts of your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had a horse of linen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That extends near the door? - Yes, it is at the door.</p>
               <p>Might not any person in passing briskly towards the door have dislodged this linen from the horse? - No, Sir, we never put any of that kind on the horse; it never was on the horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290108"/>Are you sure there was no cotton of that pattern on the horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it since you inspected the horse? - I cannot tell .</p>
               <p>Who prepared the horse for shew? - My man.</p>
               <p>Do you take upon yourself to swear, and do you expect to be believed, that when an other man furnished that horse with goods, that this cotton was not on the horse? - I will take upon myself to swear that that printed cotton was not there.</p>
               <p>How many pieces might this horse contain? - Twenty.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon yourself to swear that you took a particular note of every one of these twenty pieces that were on the horse? - I cannot swear that, but I can swear that that linen was not on the horse .</p>
               <p>Do you know where that linen lay? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Then will you say it was not on the horse? - I am sensible it was not on the horse, but I do not know where it was.</p>
               <p>How many customers had you in your shop that day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>It is a shop pretty much frequented? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many were in it at that time? - Six or eight.</p>
               <p>Then of course these people had been up and down the shop? - I admit that.</p>
               <p>Did you search this woman? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What, my friend, suspect a woman of robbing you and not search her, then of course I think you took her for an honest woman; what became of the other woman? - She went, I let her go.</p>
               <p>How did the other woman behave when you stopped the prisoner? - She stopped about five months, but she went off when I sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles. That is as much as they can do I fancy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of her did it fall from? - From her clothes, I saw it slide down, I saw it before it came entirely to the ground, I saw it falling, it fell between her and one of the horses; I was so close to her I could not be deceived, I am quite sure of it, it was under her cloak I imagine; she had a long cloak on.</p>
               <p>Did you furnish the horses? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any goods of that kind on the horses? - We never put any such common goods on the horses, this was a linen, we never put any on the horses but callicoes.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive her taking it? - I did not; it was delivered to the constable in my presence, it was the same I picked up.</p>
               <p>Constable. I had it from the counter, Mr. Graves delivered it to me.</p>

               <p>(The piece deposed to by the shop-mark, by Young and Graves.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. A man might go without touching any of them, might not he? - Yes, just steer clear.</p>
               <p>Was the other person before her or behind her, that went out of the shop with her? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you find it between the horse and the door sill, or between the horse and the counter? - Between the door sill and her, it was in the middle of the door-way, withoutside the horse.</p>
               <p>When you hand these pieces on the horse you hang the ends to shew, you put the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290109"/> heaviest inside the horse? - I am sure I found this withoutside the horse.</p>
               <p>Were you so near her as to swear that you could see distinctly whether this piece fell from her or not? - That was the woman that I saw the piece of linen fall from, I was so close that I could not be deceived, the other woman was not between me and her, I was close to this woman, but the other must be be before of course.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. That is reasoning, but you did not see that; the prisoner permitted herself to be searched very quietly? - I do not know that she was searched at all .</p>
               <p>Do you know every piece that you put on that horse? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know every piece that you put on these two horses? - I do not know exactly, but I know partly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my councel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who all gave her a very good character, and said she worked hard for her living at her neadle .</p>

               <p>Who was this man? - A carpenter I have been in company with different times, I do not know his name, nor where he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290110"/> lives ; the man sent me for the posts, but whether he is here or not I cannot say.</p>

You never saw him before ? - No, but he was in the shop ten minutes or more, I had no reason for taking particular notice of his person , I first offered him 5 s. then he said that would not do, then I offered him 6 s. then 7 s. we have a great number of people comes to our shop, it was a fortnight after when he was taken up, I knew him by his being pitted with the small-pox, and by his voice, I have no doubt at all about him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How many people came to your shop that day? - It is impossible for me to tell.</p>
               <p>Will you swear to every person that came to your shop that day? - I will not.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I live at Mr. Lane's, I was present when the instruments were pledged, they were pledged by the prisoner, I had a conversation with him, it was between eleven and twelve; he asked half a guinea on them, the lad took them of him, I was rather higher up over the counter, the boy brought them up to me, I began to look at them, and he asked what instruments they were, the prisoner said they were surgeons instruments, he said he wanted half a guinea on them, I went down to him, I said, Sir, we will lend you 5 s. upon them, he said that would not do; it is the prisoner at the bar, I know him by his features, I am sure it was him, I was in conversation with him for the space of eight minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You never saw him before? - No.</p>
               <p>What light had you? - There was sufficient light, it was lighter then than it is here.</p>
               <p>It was in one of these little private boxes? - Yes, but the prisoner leaned over the counter, took off his hat, and rubbed his head; we take particular notice of people, but I had no suspicion of him, he looked like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am afraid if any other gentleman was to come to your shop, you would know him again? - Yes, if he was so long, and was to argue as he did.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had these instruments made for myself by Bodker , his name is on every one of them, but one, which one had been lost and replaced by another maker , which is the abcess lancet .</p>
               <p>What name is on that? - I do not know , I think there is a crown upon it, but I am not certain.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290112"/>Mr. Silvester. Bodker is a great maker? - He was, but he has failed long since, and is now a porter in the India-house; I have had them three or four voyages to India, and upon the whole, I have no doubt but they are mine, I saw them the night before the robbery.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Le Brah's, in Fleet-street, when I apprehended him, he behaved very genteely, he said they were Mr. Gent's instruments when he saw them before the magistrate , he said he had had them in use, and that they were his master's instruments.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What was he asked before he said this? - He said they certainly were Mr. Gent's instruments, but he never knew of the taking them.</p>
               <p>Court. When he said these were Mr. Gent's instruments, did he accompany that with any account how he came by them? - No, when he was put to the bar to be examined before the magistrate, he heard what Mr. Gent had to say, and Mr. Gent said, with submission to your worship , I shall only ask whether they are my instruments, he said they were; he said he did not pawn them, nor know how they were lost, and he said he did not know Mr. Lane's, much less of the pawning them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I would only observe, Sir, that the boy swore at my second hearing, that Mr. Lane could as positively swear to me as he did, and when Mr. Lane was there, he could not.</p>
               <p>Meredith. I never said any such thing, Mr. Lane was present at the time I lent the money on them, but not when the prisoner first came into the shop, but he did not know the prisoner, he did not take any notice.</p>

               <p>- DE BRAH sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a chemist in Fleet-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What day was it that Count Zambeccari's balloon was to have gone up ? - I do not really recollect the day, it was on a Monday, but I do not recollect the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was not it Monday the 16th of May? - It might or it might not be, for I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is singular, when you was to have gone up in the balloon? - It is not at all singular, because I was asked to go up the same morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290113"/>Can you swear that that day was not on Whit-Monday ? - I should conceive it might be on that day, most likely on that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was on the 3d of May.</p>
               <p>Court. Whatever day of the month it was, that was one of the nights that this lad lay out, and I wish this circumstance could be ascertained, and it may very easily; the Foreman of the Jury has a recollection that it was on that Monday, one question will ease all my private doubts about it, was it on a Monday, whatever Monday it was? - I must own I cannot positively say , whether it was on a Monday or a Tuesday .</p>
               <p>The Foreman of the Jury. My wife laid in a dangerous state on that day, and she died on the day following.</p>
               <p>The Porter. It was Tuesday the 3d of May, that it was to have gone with Count Zambeccari.</p>
               <p>Court. Had Count Zambeccari made any attempt which failed before that? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Lockwood make a successful attempt afterwards? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was there any attempt between that in which he was concerned, and the other? - None that I know of.</p>
               <p>(The newspapers sent for.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, reads. On the 3d of May there was an advertisement that it was to ascend: -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to De Brah. You have said, that on the two nights you have named the prisoner was absent from your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did he sleep ? - Up in the second floor , under the maid's room.</p>
               <p>In what way was the shop door fastened? - Most commonly I go to bed last, and I generally turn the key , and leave it in the door, the reason is in case of fire.</p>
               <p>So that if anybody was so disposed, they might go out of your house without your knowledge ? - They might so certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr Silvester. Where did you lay? - In a room opposite to his.</p>
               <p>Then if he had gone out , you must have heard him? - I might or I might not.</p>

               <p>Did he hear no disturbance? - No.</p>
               <p>From the situation in which you found the door of his room, was it possible it could happen without his hearing it? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any suspicion of him? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you ever examined him upon the subject? - Yes .</p>

               <p>Why did not you bring that mate? - I cannot spare him, I believe firmly nothing of it .</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of man is that man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290114"/> in person? - A short man, not so tall as the prisoner is, he is rather lustier.</p>
               <p>Very much unlike him? - No resemblance of him.</p>
               <p>Court to Meredith . Have you ever seen Mr. Gent's other shopman? - I did see him when I took the instruments to his house.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man is he? - He is a young man, I cannot say what sort of a man he is.</p>
               <p>Is he the size of the prisoner? - I think he is.</p>
               <p>Now recollect the person of that man, and say whether there is any resemblance between him and the person that brought the things to you? - I do not think there is in the features, but he is about the size; I looked at the prisoner, and I swear positively he is the person that delivered the instruments to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. At what time was you alarmed? - At five in the morning.</p>

               <p>I am a collar maker, I live at Acton , on the second of June the prosecutor sent his servant to my house for me to go with him to Norwood on some particular business, and he would serve me as much another time; I went with him to Mr. Woodstock's house, the farmer's, it was about nine or between nine and ten, Mr. Fisher asked me if I understood whether a harness had been worn or no, because he had seen one there, and he was pretty sure it was his, he was partly sure that was the word, and whilst we were disputing upon it, the servant came, and Mr. Fisher sent for me, to consult me on this harness; I never saw this harness before to take notice of it, I have seen it go past my door, this is the same harness, and it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>What is the use of a ring if applied to this harness, is not it a common thing to put these rings to harnesses? - I never saw it in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that this ring is a singular thing? - Yes, I never saw it in the trade before.</p>
               <p>Is it so singular in the trade that a man may very safely swear to it? - It is quite uncommon in the trade.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You said, you had seen this harness? - I saw them go by my house.</p>
               <p>How many harnesses have you seen go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290115"/> by your house to Acton ? - Only three at one time of Mr. Fisher's, some are made with rings, and some are not.</p>
               <p>If I desired you to take off the rings, would not you take them off for me? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Would not you cover it then? - I should not put it into your hands for a new harness.</p>

               <p>Did he say anything in your hearing? - Nothing that night, I saw nothing there that night, the next morning we got up, and I went over to the farmer's with my master, and there I saw the leather cart back-band, the maid servant shewed it me, I knew it by having sweat upon it, that came from off the horse in several places, there was no other mark upon it by which I could know it; I went into the prisoner's shop on the Tuesday, when he was making a bit of a halter about eleven, and I asked him who it was for, and he said for Mr. Woodstock, that he was going to send over a horse harness there, and there was no other harness in the shop (The harness deposed to, and the crupper.) I swear to the drupper by the hole where the hinge of the crupper went through it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live about a mile from the prosecutor's, I bespoke of the prisoner a harness for one horse, he brought me a complete harness on Wednesday the first of June, I was to have a new harness, and I paid for it as such; it was brought home in the day light publickly, it laid open then on the dresser not in any brown paper, I had no doubt but it was a new harness, it laid in the kitchen which is an open room where we live.</p>
               <p>Did you see anything like the sweating of a horse on any part of them? - I did not at that time, I did not examine it minutely because I had no such thought.</p>
               <p>Was it pointed out to you the next day or did you perceive it yourself that there was any sweating of a horse upon it? - It was pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>By who? - By Mr. Fisher, I was gone to town when Mr. Croxford came.</p>
               <p>Is the harness now produced, the harness that was taken from your house? - I believe it is, it is like it, I would not go to swear to the harness, because other harnesses may be like it, I was not at home when it was taken away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fisher. I went for a warrant, and he said you must bring the harness with you, so we took the prisoner up, and I went round and fetched the harness from Mr. Woodstock's wife.</p>
               <p>Court to Woodstock. Had you any other new harness but this? - No.</p>
               <p>Fisher. I put it into a sack, and carried it to Mr. Lamb's, then Lamb gave it to Croxford, I saw it given to him.</p>
               <p>Croxford. I kept it in my possession ever since, till I brought it into Court now.</p>
               <p>Jury to Woodstock . Did you think it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290116"/> sweated? - I cannot think about it, it did look as if it had been put on a horse, but I will not swear it had, and Mr. Fisher pointed out a hole in the crupper, as if it had been made to fit his buckle.</p>
               <p>Court to Croxford. What is the fair charge for these several articles? - Six shillings for that back-band, and with crupper and straps about nine shillings, the belly band two shillings and sixpence; the prisoner is a collar maker, and I have often dealt with him, I know no harm of him.</p>
               <p>Croxford. I never saw a crupper so made before, but it is possible that a collar maker for his convenience or his customers, might make such alterations as is made in that harness, the leather is put on with single thread, and the other is put on with double thread.</p>

               <p>What was he at work upon then? - On a crupper and hip straps for Mr. Woodstock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The man heard Mr. Woodstock speak for them.</p>
               <p>Seymour. I was present when he ordered them (looks at it) it is the same that hung up there, I know the crupper but nothing else; I am sure of it by this place, this hole, I told him, says I, Mr. Clarke, this is one that you cut out for your father.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My father lives in Essex, he spoke to me for a set of harnesses, and he did not like the crupper.</p>
               <p>Do you keep house at Southall ? - Yes, I was to make a pair of wooden hames for Mr. Woodstock , and I went in to see how forward he was, as I had not made them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who all gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Fisher . I was up that morning at five, and I saw him at my gate.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Who made this collar of your's? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Currier. How long do you think it is since that leather was curried? - I do not think it had been curried a vast while, and might perhaps about three months, but I do not think it had been worn.</p>
               <p>Court to Currier. Can you say with any certainty, or can you not? - I can.</p>
               <p>Jury to Fisher. When did you buy this harness? - About Christmas.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the lady at the bar, I was present at her marriage at St. Martin's church, I gave her away; I am sure she is the same person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who are you? - A housekeeper down at Wapping.</p>
               <p>You knew Allen very well? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you know what name this woman used to go by? - By the name of Mrs. Allen.</p>
               <p>Did you tell her Allen was dead, and died abroad? - No, I never told her so.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear anybody else tell her that? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>That is a little aukward swearing? - I never did hear it.</p>
               <p>Have you carried any message from Allen to this woman since this marriage was discovered? - Never.</p>
               <p>You was not the man that offered to make it up for three guineas? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did Allen continue to live at with her? - I do not know, I was gone to sea.</p>
               <p>How long did you continue to live at home after they were married? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How did this man behave to her? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Coombes. You are the attorney for this prosecution? - I am.</p>
               <p>Did you ever offer to make it up for a sum of money?</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I object to that question.</p>
               <p>Had you directions to make it up for Allen for three guineas? - No, most solemnly not.</p>
               <p>Court . The rule in civil cases is clearly that he shall not divulge the secrets of his client; any thing that comes to his knowledge in the capacity of an attorney to his client; did you know this man when he lived with the woman at the bar? - I certainly did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, may I be permitted to prove that this man, during the short time he lived with the prisoner, treated her in a most brutal manner, and forced her to submit to prostitution to maintain him before he abandoned her.</p>
               <p>Court. That might lay her under the necessity of quitting one husband, but could not lay her under the necessity of marrying another.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. You keep a public house? - Yes, this woman was a servant of mine, a house keeper.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say she lived with you as a common servant? - I looked upon her to be in trust so far as this, you might come in and think we were man and wife.</p>
               <p>Aye, I thought so; why, did not every one else think so? - People that did not know us might.</p>
               <p>How long has she lived with you? - At different times she has lived with me twelve years; she lived with me eight years together.</p>
               <p>Did not she pay the taxes, and take the house for you when you was a bankrupt? - She never took a house for me when I was a bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Did not she pay the bills? - I paid my bills in general; I have said to my servants, go and see where she is gone.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that? - I will not.</p>
               <p>When you sent her to pay the rent, did not she pay it as Mrs. Marshall, and your wife? - She paid it on my account no doubt, and Mr. Wallis might certainly think she was Mrs. Marshall.</p>
               <p>Did not you treat her in every respect as your wife; you quarrelled sometimes like man and wife, did you not? - There are very few but may have words.</p>
               <p>You used to beat her too, I believe? - I have servants now that I take and beat; I have a nephew now that I beat.</p>
               <p>Now this watch, did not you in one of your loving fits give her this watch? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Was not you vexed when the man prisoner took her away? - I never heard of such a thing till I found it out, till I traced the marriage.</p>
               <p>Was not you angry at losing your deary? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not she and you live in every respect like man and wife? - Upon my oath we did not live in every respect or pass to all the world as man and wife.</p>

               <p>Had not you a marriage agreement? - As to any marriage agreement that is erroneous, it could not be, she knew my wife well all along; my wife lived in the country, there was a disagreement between her family and me, and she lived in the country.</p>
               <p>Who had the care and management of your bed and all your property? - The housekeeper had the management of the curtains and the bed, I was a little intoxicated that night, and fell asleep.</p>

               <p>These pawnbrokers are quite strangers to you? - Yes, I do not live their way.</p>
               <p>They are not the pawnbrokers you deal with? - No, Sir, I go nearer my neighbours.</p>
               <p>What is the name of the pawnbroker you deal with? - Davis, in London Wall.</p>
               <p>You are a pretty good customer of his? - I do not say that I am.</p>
               <p>Who did you send in general? - I sent anybody that I liked to ask.</p>
               <p>Who was the first - Any body that was in the way.</p>
               <p>How often have you sent the prisoner at the bar think you? - Never, I never sent her in my life, so help me God.</p>
               <p>Did you ever pledge anything of hers? - No never, she had nothing to pledge.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker, on the 25th of April the prisoner whom I have seen before, more than once, brought a man's cloth coat, which I have here, to our shop, it appears by my ticket to be on the 5th of April, I am sure as to the person of the prisoner; I lent 13 s. upon it, I take that to be very near the value of it; on the 27th following she brought a scarlet cloth cloak, and a linen shift, I lent 3 s. on the shift, the cloak I lent 14 s. on; the value is 16 s; I do not observe any particular mark upon them of any kind, and they are new; there is nothing distinguishable in them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You would not venture to swear to them? - I would not myself swear to them by no means; I have been in that way of business ten years, or more, and from any observation I could make of these, I could not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Having looked at them attentively, if they had been out of your hands a day or two, would you venture to swear to them? - No; the prisoner was in the habit of coming to our shop from another person, and I understood from her that the coat was the property of that person, and the cloak and the shift of another person, she described them so.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - It was in daylight I am confident, I think it was somewhere between eleven and four, but nearer than that I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. These are such things no person can swear to them? - I had them in my possession, with the duplicates upon them, if anybody had substituted others for them, I could not swear to them, but I have no reason to suspect that; the coat is the 25th of April, the cloak and the shift on the 27th following.</p>
               <p>(The things looked at by the Prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. By what marks do you know them? - I can say with a safe conference that they are mine; the shift is new, it has no mark.</p>
               <p>Do you think it is impossible for you to be mistaken? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Might anybody else have such another cloak? - They might.</p>
               <p>Had nobody else a new shift at that time? - I believe they might.</p>
               <p>Now about the coat? - It had been worn two or three times.</p>
               <p>So has one I have got at home. - I dare say you wear better cloth than this.</p>
               <p>Did you make the shift yourself? - No, I never makes nothing; the cloak was made at No. 2, Houndsditch, I have worn it twice.</p>
               <p>To the best of your belief do you think it is yours? - Yes, my husband has not had the coat on since it was at the pawnbrokers; I believe this to be the coat; I know such things were missing on that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my councel.</p>
               <p>Jury to Pawnbroker. Do not you often take in things upon which you do not immediately put a ticket? - It frequently happens in the hurry of business that we do not put them on immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear that that was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290132"/> same woman that brought you these things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who all gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>In what terms did they own it? - They said, they were sorry for it, and wished I would be favourable to them.</p>
               <p>Sorry for what? - For what they had done, Knock had dressed herself up in my wife's cloaths, and went up to Whitechapel, and there she got herself into trouble, and she sent Mrs. Wilkie to pawn the gown, she said she only dressed herself in them to go out; we lost the things mentioned in the indictment; at the Rotation office they owned taking the other things, there was no promise of favour made them, they owned it voluntarily ; they said, they had been carrying out things for a fortnight before, the very same time I went to church to marry my wife, they carried things out, and pawned them some of the things were found at Mr. Rolfe's the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>On the 4th of June, as Lucas and I were standing in Holborn, talking about some business, three men passed us between five and six; as soon as the prisoner passed us he crossed the way, Lucas said, that fellow has got something, I went through a court and overtook him in St. Giles's , and Lucas held him, and I pulled this piece of ribbon out of his pocket, and the prosecutor owned it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, in this case the sentence is not set forth in the indictment, the offence is being at large, after having received the King's pardon, on condition of transporting himself; I move to quash the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. It is sufficient to effect the prisoner that he had received sentence of transportation, and was found at large; the condition is broken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I am for the prisoner, and the prosecutor now exercising his judgment on the case, says his evidence will not meet his case; these sort of applications are not favourable to prisoners, there is nothing bad on the face of the indictment; your Lordship sees that this defendent has pleaded; and what is the error on the face of the record; it states the conviction, it states the sentence, and the breach<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290140"/> of that sentence; but it is not true in point of fact, because that sentence was altered by the King's pardon, but your Lordship do not know that in a judicial way.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the end of your objection?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Why my Lord, that this poor devil may be remanded to his former sentence, instead of being hanged; and that he may be acquitted on the defect of the fact applying to this indictment: he is indicted now because he has been at large after the judgment of transportation passed in this court; when that is disposed of, the other is a quite different offence; whether he has been guilty of the breach of the King's pardon or not.</p>
               <p>Court. He must be acquitted on this indictment, and remanded till the next sessions.</p>

               <p>The first time this Bacharah came to my house, I have seen him before, because Mr. Butts heard this man say, if I would make him a present, he would not hurt the boy, he came to me before I applied to him; and when he came he told me, that the allowance of the Court would be fifteen shillings, or a guinea; I told him it was not in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290143"/> power to give so much; and he told me the least he could take was half a guinea: I had but five shillings , and the five shillings I gave him; well, then, he said, I will take it as you can give it me ; I gave him the five shillings, and he came to me last Thursday was a fortnight, says he, I have been to Hicks's-Hall, and I have been buying a bedstead , says he, I am to give fifteen shillings, and have got but twelve; I said you may have three shillings more of the money if you have a mind, and I gave him three shillings more; says I, I have not the money now, but if you will call again in an hour's time, I can get the money, and he called again; and last Thursday as ever was, he came and had the other half crown; I have a woman by that is a witness of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Bacharah. Is this true? - It is as false as God is true.</p>
               <p>Did you ever receive any thing from her? - I never received a farthing from her to abandon this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any sum from her on any account? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I know no otherwise than I have seen this man three or four times, and he came in to the prisoner's mother's on Friday last, and said I wish you would let me have that money, and she went and gave him two shillings and sixpence; he said she had no occasion to make herself uneasy at all about it.</p>
               <p>What are you? - My husband is a jeweller, a lodger, I live on Saffron-hill.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - A good while, about four months.</p>
               <p>Was it a half crown piece? - It was two shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Mother. My Lord, yesterday morning this Bacharah came to me, and said, so I find you have told the constable that you have given me half-a-guinea; how could you be so good for nothing woman ; but says he you have no occasion to bring anybody to his character, for so long as I bring the boy off, what is that to you .</p>

               <p>Court. Let Isaac Bacharah be committed to Newgate, and you must prosecute him for compounding felony : it is a gross misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Bacharah. My Lord, I hope you will send me to Woodstreet Compter , I shall be killed by the prisoners in Newgate, they do not like me.</p>

            , as justly to incur the censure and indignation both of the Court and Jury; there appeared very great reason to suspect that you were guilty at least of the crime of compounding felony, if not of the greater crime of perjury; however, as you expressed at the time a sense of the fault that you had committed, the Court will dismiss you at present with a reprimand, hoping this narrow escape will be a warning to you, and that you will never again presume to enter a Court of Justice , but with the purest motives of public justice, and the strictest regard to truth in the whole of your future deportment.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear to any particular mark in my face? - No, I cannot, but I swear to his person altogether , he is dressed different.</p>
               <p>Jury. What parted the two houses at top? - A bit of a wall, about five or six feet.</p>
               <p>Was there any part where you could walk straight on, without getting over? - No.</p>
               <p>Could a man with tolerable case get over that wall? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, at a quarter before five in the morning, I was called by Mrs. Longford, I went with him, and waited outside the prisoner's door half an hour, I heard a hammering, but what it was I could not tell, the noise was in his own shop, close to the door; we waited, and the prisoner opened the door, I said, halloo! what do you do here, and I desired Mr. Jenkinson to mind the door while I looked about, I saw a cupboard door placed close underneath the window, and under that there were several pieces of lead, and I saw this adze just over the lead in the window, the prisoner seemed very much confused, and did not give me an answer; we searched all the house, but found no other tools: there was a wheel-barrow, and a few staves in his own business, I asked the prisoner how he could be guilty of anything of that sort, he said he had laid out a good deal of money on the house, he said nothing else, I made no promise to him; I went up to the top of the house to see which way he got out, and I went out, and could get on Mr. Moorish's house, as easy as I can go down these steps; there is a gutter that goes from the prisoner's house to Mr. Moorish's house, his trap door was open; there was a great deal of lead missing, and I afterwards examined the lead with the places they came from, at the top of Mr. Moorish's house, and these three pieces tallied exactly, they came from the middle; I cannot say whether these three pieces were in the bag, but there was some of the lead taken upon the prisoner; these pieces were folded together<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290146"/> all of them, I beat it out at my own shop, and then took it out flat, but when I measured it, I trod it down with my feet, I only smoothed the others.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the situation of the roof such that a person not being very conversant with the two houses, could suppose himself to be on one house, when he was actually on the other? - He could not, there is a gutter between the two roofs first, and then there is a gutter adjoining to the wall, the wall is between three and four feet.</p>
               <p>Is the roof of the house he lived in leaded? - No, it is not, only the gutter and the trap door at the top of it, and not leaded.</p>
               <p>Does the house he lives in and that from which the lead was taking join in any part? - No.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I live in the house, it was rather out of repair, I moved out of it, I had some lodgers, and I told them to quit it as soon as possible; these people had nowhere to go to, and I told them, it is not material for a few days, you may stay here, they sent word they would quit the place on Monday, and I waited, and waited, and on Tuesday morning when I was taken, I came for the key, I knocked at the door and I could not make them hear, and a boy came running down stairs, says he I have been up stairs, seeing what it was o'clock, and I sent him to tell his father, I must have the key; when he was gone, I looked about, and packed up my things, and I went and opened the door to give a little light, and refreshment; and the prosecutor came up, and said, you are my prisoner, and it struck me so, I did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did you see to pack up your things? - There was a sky light, and a sufficient light over the door, and the windows gave light enough.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of June I caught the prisoner at the cart's tail, between two and three in the afternoon, I caught him pulling the staves open and taking the tobacco out of a hogshead, he was doing it with his hands, I saw him take this, and he put it under his arm, and he had it under his arm when I took him; he might have about a couple of pounds, as near as I can guess, it was leaf tobacco; I said, come my friend, I have had many a run after you, but you have got off; says he, I hope you will not hurt me, and I gave him in charge to the Compter; I never lost sight of him, I am sure he is the man, I left the tobacco at my master's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunter. I had the tobacco, there were about seventy hogsheads, there were three hogsheads laying on the ground, it is American tobacco; I was there two or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290151"/> three times that day, I had the care of all the tobacco that came by this ship.</p>

As you had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290152"/> the child, what did you do to learn to whom it belonged? - I advertized it some days after, and in consequence of some information I received , I apprehended the prisoner, and she said, that child was her's, that it was a bastard child born in the parish of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, and that she had applied to the parish for some relief, and they refused it, because she did not belong to that parish, and that she brought it to us, because she could not maintain it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any threat or promise made to her? - No, not a word, I am sure of it.</p>
