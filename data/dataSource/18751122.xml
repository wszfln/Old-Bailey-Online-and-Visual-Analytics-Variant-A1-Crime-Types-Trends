                  </hi>. I am deputy surveyor to the metropolitan police force—I know the premises 215, Whitechapel Road, they are on the right hand side going from London—this model (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct model of the premises made to the scale of a quarter of an inch to one foot—it also embraces Mr. Pinnell's and Mr. Wiseman's premises—it extends back to the back of Mr. Pinnell's premises, and goes beyond at the back into Vine Court which is shown here, and so are the outbuildings—I have also got a ground plan of the premises made to scale, showing the exit from Vine Court in this direction—it is in fact a chart of the immediate locality—I have taken it from the Ordnance Map; it shows the premises 215, and 84, on the other side of the road, and Sidney Square and the neighbourhood—I also produce a model of the Hen and Chickens which I made myself—this is a model of the cellar of the Hen and Chickens—the only entrance to the cellar is down these stairs, and when you get into the cellar there is no window or any light, or any access whatever except down the steps—at the bottom of these stairs there is an inner cellar of brick work, and a hole in the brick work of about 2 feet 6 to 3 feet, which I believe has always been there from its appearance—it is long enough for a person to creep through—I got through it—in the inside there was a large quantity of loose earth, and there are props propping up the inside of the shop as shown here—this shows the way down stairs at the Hen and Chickens which leads from the shop to the first floor—this is the entrance to the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, Baker's Row, Whitechapel, and am a brush maker—in September this year I was in Mr. Martin's service as manager, at 78, New Road, Whitechapel—the prisoner Henry Wainwright was also in his service as a manager—I was in the service five or six weeks, and Henry Wainwright about eleven weeks before the particular Saturday—I have known Henry Wainwright between seventeen and eighteen years—he carried on a brushmakers business formerly at 84, Whitechapel Road—that was the shop at which the articles were sold—I worked for him away from the premises, and used to take my work home to the shop—I have worked for him on and off for between seventeen and eighteen years—I know the premises 215, Whitechapel Road as a packing place—a man named West used to live there first—I am speaking about the time when Wainwright had the premises—West was his chief clerk and lived there—West left somewhere in July, 1874, after which the premises were unoccupied so far as to persons living there, but they were used for packing premises down stairs—they remained unoccupied as a residence till Rogers went there in November, 1874—they were shut up at night, and I believe the keys were always put in the counting house at No. 84, until the fire—Henry Wainwright went out of business about a month before he went into Mr. Martin's service, he then told me that he lived at School House Lane, Chingford, but I never went to his place—on the Thursday or Friday before Saturday, 11th September, 1875, I told him that I had bought a chain for the scales (we were then in Mr. Martin's shop)—he said "Oh yes, it is very useful," and then he said "I have a chopper and a shovel to sell likewise, which will be very useful," I said "So they will, sir, as we require them for the place"—nothing more was said at that time—we were at work on the Saturday afternoon about 6.30 in Mr. Martin's presence, and he said "Will you carry a parcel for me, Stokes?"—I said "Yes sir, with the greatest of pleasure" we then left together and went to 215, Whitechapel Road—we went in at the back through Vine Court—he took a key out of his pocket and opened the door—we both went in and he asked me to go upstairs and fetch down a parcel—I went upstairs underneath this part, and through by the sky light into the dwelling rooms—that was 80 or 90 feet from the spot where we came in—I looked for the parcel but could not find it—I went down found him at the furthest end of the place, and told him I could not find any parcel—he said "Never mind, Stokes, I will find them where I placed them a fortnight ago, under the straw"—there was some straw there, not in the corner but just on the stone work—as you enter from Vine Court there are some flag stones—I saw the straw up in a corner and saw two parcels tied round with rope and some black American cloth—he said "These are the parcels I want you to carry, Stokes"—I lifted them up and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220005"/>
               <p>I says "They are too heavy for me, sir," and I put them down again—he said "Wait a bit Stokes, here is the shovel and the chopper that I want you to sell for me"—they were lying on the floor and a" hammer also—(he had told me that he wanted me to sell them to Mr. Martin, my employer)—I said "All right, sir," and I picked up the axe—that is what I call the choppes—I said "What is this, sir, it stinks?"and I saw some mess on it—he said "It is only cat's or dog's dirt," and took his hand wiped it off, and then wiped it on a piece of newspaper and laid it on the floor—then he said "Come along Stokes," and I went to go to the door, and picked up both the parcels and said "They stink so bad and the weight of them is too heavy, for me"—he said "I will take one off of you at the bottom of Vine Court"—as I walked to the door he said "Wait a bit, Stokes, let me see if old (or Mr.) Johnson is a watching us"—I know Johnson, he is a decorator in the Mile End Road—his premises do not overlook the place—he was not there then, but he generally was there on the look out when anything was being removed—I have often seen him there—he then said "All right, Stokes, no one is look<lb/>ing, come on"—I had the two parcels in my hand and carried them out of Vine Court into Whitechapel, where he took the lightest one off of me—we walked to Whitechapel Church, which was about a quarter of a mile—while we were going along I said "I shall have to rest, sir, it is too heavy for me, I cannot carry it"—he said "Oh for God's sake don't drop them or else you will break them"—when we got to Whitechapel Church he said "Mind those parcels Stokes, while I go and fetch a cab"—I said "All right, sir"—he went for a cab and put his parcel down by the side of mine opposite Blyth's the wire workers—while he was away I looked at the largest parcel, the one I carried myself; I felt as if I must do it—I opened it, and the first thing I saw was a human head, and then proceeding further I saw a hand which had been cut off at the wrist, and then I had the presence of mind to <hi rend="italic">kiver</hi> it up again quick and wait till Mr. Wainwright returned with a four-wheeled cab—I had been left with the parcels about five minutes before he came back—he then asked me to help him to the cab with the parcels, which I did with a little hesitation—I put one parcel in and Mr. Wainwright put the other in at the bottom of the cab, and said he would see me in the evening at my place—I said "All right, sir," and then he got in the cab—it drove off up Church Lane towards the East India Docks—he was not smoking when he got into the cab, he was when he got out—I heard him <hi rend="italic">give</hi> the order to drive to the Commercial Road—he said "Round to the left"—the cabman drove down Church Lane which leads to the Commercial Road—the cab turned to the left—we were at the top of Church Lane at the time—I saw them to the corner—Church Lane leads to the Commercial Road—turning to the left leads away from the City—the cab went on as far as the chemists shop in the Commercial Road on the left—I ran after it and it stopped outside the chemists shop—I know the neighbourhood; it is by the Plumbers Arms close by Greenfield Street, and about 70 yards from the end of Church Lane—when the cab stopped Henry Wainwright got out and walked towards the West India Dock, away from the City—I saw a young woman called Alice Day meet him, and he accompanied her back to the cab, after talking with her for about a minute—she was standing at the corner of the street as if waiting for him, and then they both got into the cab—I was hiding in a doorway opposite—he said to the cabman "Drive on as fast as you can over London Bridge to the Borough"—he turned his head round directly to the City way, and I ran</p>

               <p>after the cab until I saw two constables by Leadenhall Street—I called their attention to the cab as I was then exhausted, but they laughed at me and said "Man, you must be mad"—I called to them to stop the cab—I did not tell them why—I could not speak at the time—the cab was then 30 yards ahead of me, I ran after it again; it went by Leadenhall Street and Fenchurch Street over London Bridge and stopped outside the hop factory on the right hand side of the Borough, which is part of the premises of the London Joint Stock Bank—you can see the Hen and Chickens pretty well from there, by standing a little on one side—I saw Wainwright put not his hand which caused the cab to stop at the entrance—he got out and took out the lightest parcel and went towards the Hen and Chickens—I told two con<lb/>stables Turner and Cox, No. 48 and 290; I said "For God's sake run after the man with the high hat with the parcels in his hand, there is something wrong," and Turner done it instantly—I then told Cox and he went to the cab—I told Turner not to touch him, but to follow him and see where he was going with it—Cox spoke to Alice Day but I could not hear the words—I saw Turner follow Wainwright to the Hen and Chickens on the other side—shortly afterwards Wainwright returned and went to the cab te get the other parcel, but I did not see what he did as I ran back to my employer, Mr. Martin, knowing that they were in good hands—when he spoke about the shovel and chopper he said "Ask him to buy them in the presence of me, and I will say that they are very useful"—I said "How much shall I ask for them"—(I have stated this before)—he said "Will you call for them on Monday morning, Stokes?"—I said "All right, sir, how much shall 1 ask for them I"—he said "I will leave that to you"—I was to say that they were my own and sell them in my own name—this was said both at Mr. Martin's and at the other premises—I have known Alice Day between three and four years—she was employed at the Pavilion Theatre, the front entrance of which is next door to 84. Whitechapel Road—she was ballet girl there—I have seen her with Henry Wainwright many and many a time in public-houses, and walking out together in the street—I had seen him with her in the Commercial Road I believe a fortnight or three weeks before—I remember Thomas Wainwright coming in and out of the shop in Whitechapel Road when he was only a young man—I knew him as the brother of Henry—he used to keep the Hen and Chickens in the Borough—I have been outside the door very many times waiting for Mr. Wainwright—I do not know where Thomas lived in September 1874, or in September last—I had noticed a smell for a few months before the 11th September—I should say it was in June or July this year—it was supposed to come from the rubbish in this corner close to the paint room, which is under the warehouse—the rubbish was dirt and cabbage leaves which had been lying there for months and months—I spoke to the clerk and to Titiens, the porter, about the umbrella—I-was not in Wainwright's service; I was employed by him—I made up the work and took it home—I then noticed the smell, but I did not notice any particular time, because I always put it down to the rubbish—the rubbish was not removed till after this was found out.</p>

               <p>don't think I mentioned about Henry Wainwright speaking to me about the chopper and spade—I believe I did mention about his saying "All right, no one is looking, come on"—I believe I said it at the Treasury—I know I did say it, whether at the inquest or at the court I cannot say—what he said was "Wait a bit, Stokes, let us see if Mr. Johnson or old Johnson is looking, for he always is if we are doing anything"—perhaps I did not say that before—he said "I wonder he is not watching us as he always is, and he told me to wait to see if he was watching"—I have stated before to day that when I first took up the parcels they stunk so bad, and the weights was too heavy for me—they did smell very bad—I thought it was hair till I got up to Whitechapel Road, because we had been talking about hair on the way to 215—I said either at the inquest or before the magistrate that whilst I was carrying the parcels I said to Henry Wainwright "I shall have to have a rest, it is too heavy, I can't carry it"—I can't say on which exami<lb/>nation it was, but I know I said it—I have not been to the Treasury since 1 was bound over before the Magistrate, nor has any one been to me—I have not had any writing put into my hand—I have never seen this model till to day, till it was in Court—I noticed when I went upstairs that the place was quite empty, except an old umbrella—I said I could not say—whose umbrella it was, I was never asked particularly whose it was—I was asked whether it was the umbrella of the lady I had seen talking to Mr. Wain-wright, and I said, I could not tell.</p>

I was seventeen or eighteen years in the employ of Henry Wainwright and his father—at the time I first went to the father Thomas Wainwright was quite a young chap—at that time Henry Wainwright was working in the business with his father; he was a young man then—there is not so much as ten years difference in age between the brothers; not above six or seven I suppose.</p>

I think the father has been dead twelve or thirteen years—after that William and Henry carried on the business as partners—after they ceased to be partners Henry and Mr. Sawyer carried it on—Mr. Sawyer came in about November, 1873, and they dissolved partnership in July, 1874—after that Henry had the place to himself, and carried on the business at both places until the fire—there are gates or folding doors at the front of 215 with a sort of fan-light over the top—when you get in at the front there are no doors to go through; it is all open space right to the end—at the end of the warehouse where the sky lights are, there was formerly a paint shop partitioned off from the rest of the room—the flooring of the paint shop was a little raised from the rest of the floor, one step; it was not used to keep paints in, but for storing painting brushes in; it is called a paint room in the trade—there was a door in the partition leading from the body of the warehouse into the paint room—on the right as you go in there is a door leading into Vine Court—a little way in front of that doorway the place was flagged—the partition was there when I worked for Henry Wainwright, but it was pulled down—I believe in June or July last, when Mr. Rogers was there—when the fixtures were sold to Mr. Martin the remainder of the fixtures were left, and the gas fittings—there were two lots of fixtures taken away; the last lot were taken away about August, and the first late in June or the beginning of July that Wainwright bad been taken away; the partition was there then, but not at the time the last lot was taken away; it had been removed—I don't believe it was part of the fixtures there—what had been the paint room was open to the</p>

               <p>rest of the room—the flooring of the paint room was boarded, and so was the rest of the warehouse, except the part that was flagged—that was at the furthermost end—the floor of the paint room was raised a little, and then the stone work of the other place was <hi rend="italic">ris</hi> higher still—on entering from Vine Court you would first place your foot upon some flagging which ex<lb/>tends a few feet from the entrance—that flagging is a little above the floor of the warehouse, and there is a fire-place in the warehouse, about the center on the right—when I spoke about hair I was referring to hair that we use in our trade, pig's bristles—if they are not cleaned and dressed they smell rather peculiar, but not quite so bad as that did—we do not use size; we use pitch or glue—I thought the parcels contained hair.</p>

On Saturday evening, 11th September, at 5.4, I was on duty in High Street, Borough, at the corner of St. Thomas Street—whilst there the witness, Stokes, spoke to me; he seemed very much exhausted, he had his hat in his hand and perspired very much in the face; he made a communication to me, in consequence of which I went up to a cab which was just drawing up; the cabman was just commencing to rein up at the corner of Southward Street—I went up to the cab, I saw Henry Wainwright get out of the cab really before it had stopped, he was carrying a parcel in his right hand—I walked a little way down on the other side of the road to see where he went; I saw him go into an empty, house called the Hen and Chickens; he put the parcel down on the footway, took a key from his pocket, unlocked the padlock, and went in—I then went back to the cab, which was then about 45 yards from the Hen and Chickens—Cox 290 came up—there was a female in the cab who I now know to be Alice Day, and there was a parcel on the front seat tied up in American cloth with a large string, it was about 18 inches long and about 9 or ten inches wide—I spoke to the female and had some conversation with her—Cox stood behind the cab—I joined him—I waited till-Henry Wainwright came out, I could see him come out from where I was standing, he put the bolt on the door and came and walked straight on towards the cab—he did not lock the door, he had the padlock in his pocket, he was smoking a very large cigar; I did not observe whether he had been smoking before, his back was towards me at that time—he went to the off side of the cab, the side nearest the street, and opened the door and took out the parcel with his left hand—I said "What have you got there, sir"—he said "Why do you interfere with me, I am only going down to an old friend of mine"—I walked alongside of him under the Town Hall until we got to the Hen and Chickens, the door was shut, but the padlock off—he seemed to want to pass by it—I caught hold of him and we stopped—I said "Do you live here?"—he said "No"—I said "Have you got any business here?"—he said "Yes, and you have not"—I said "Go inside"—he seemed very reluctant to go in—Cox then joined me and we pushed him inside—when we got inside I said "How came you in possession of this place, I thought it belonged to Mr. Lewis?"—he said "So it does now, say nothing and ask no questions and there is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each for you"—I had him inside at this time—Cox then barred the door, there was a bar</p>

               <p>inside, there was no fastening—we walked a few steps down the shop together, he had the parcel in his left hand all the time—I said to him "What did you do with the first parcel that you brought in here"—he said it is only on the first floor—I told Cox to go up and see if he could see it—I had hold of the prisoner then—we walked down the shop together about half a dozen steps when I saw the parcel in a dark corner on the cellar steps—I then called Cox down and said "Get hold of this man and I will see what is in the parcel"—Cox took hold of him and I went and put the parcel on an old counter en the left hand side of the shop; it was then I perceived what a dreadful stench it was—before I proceeded to open the parcel Henry Wainwright said "Don't open it, policeman, pray don't look at it, whatever you do don't touch it"—I then pulled the cloth over and my fingers came across the scalp of a bead, across the ear—I found that it contaned part of the remains of a human body—I then got hold of the prisoner and Cox went to get the <hi rend="italic">ceb</hi>, which at that time was still in the same place—the prisoner said "I will give you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will <hi rend="italic">give</hi> you 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and produce the money in twenty minutes if you will let me go;" he said nothing more—the cab was then brought up to the door, Cox put the first parcel in, the prisoner was still holding the second parcel in his left hand all the time, from the time he took it from the cab till it was taken from him by Cox—<hi rend="italic">Cox</hi> came back for it, and as he went to take it from him the prisoner threw himself round as if to throw the parcel away from him—they were put into the cab and the prisoner also; the woman was still in the cab—we were then all driven to the station—from the place where the cab was first drawn up you could see the Hen and Chickens by standing 2 or 3 feet out in the road, from the back of the cab, not if you stood on the footway—from where the cab stood to the Hen and Chickens was between 40 and 45 yards—on the way to the station the female said to the prisoner "Mr. Wainwright, you have done a fine thing for me," or words to that effect, to which he made no reply—the parcels were put down in the yard at the station, they were found to contain portions of a female body much decomposed; the features were not recognisable, the hair on the head was very much clotted with blood, lime, and dirt—Mr. Larkin, the surgeon saw them and they were taken to St. Saviour's dead-house the same evening after Mr. Larkin had seen them—at the station Henry Wainwright and Alice Day were placed in the dock and were charged with having in their possession a human body decomposed, supposed to be murdered—they both made a statement which was taken down by Inspector Fox in writing—I saw a black leather bag in the cab, it was an ordinary black travelling bag, it was empty; I did not notice whether there was a newspaper in it, as far as I know it was empty.</p>

I am a Police Inspector—On Saturday the 11th September last I was on duty at the Stones End police station, Southwark, when Henry Wainwright and Alice Day were brought there with the two parcels and the bag—Turner said to me "Mr. Fox here is a man and woman with two parcels; I think they are wrong"—I said to Henry Wain-wright "What are in those parcels and where did you get them"—he said "I do not know what they contain, a gentleman gave them to me to carry"—I took them into the yard adjoining, opened them, and saw that they contained portions of a body—I sent for Mr. Larkin, and he examined them—he then made some statement to me, and I directed Henry Wainwright and Alice Day to be put into the dock—I said to them "I will charge you with having the remains of a female in your possession believed to have been murdered," and I asked him for his name and address he gave it me as "Henry Wainwright, 78 New Road, Whitechapel; will you send for my friend Mr. Martin, you will find him at 78 New Road, and I will tell you in his presence how I became possessed of these parcels"—I went myself for Mr. Martin—I did not bring him back to the station; he came in the meantime before I arrived; Stokes had fetched him—I found him there when I returned—Henry Wainwright and Alice Day were again placed in the dock and charged as before—Henry Wainwright made a statement which I took down in writing—this is it: "Yesterday week, I think, a gentleman known to me for some time by meeting him in public houses, asked me if I wished to earn a pound or two. I said' Yes, I am always willing to make money, or something of that sort. He said 'I can put a sovereign or two in your way.' I then enquired how, and he said 'By taking two parcels over to the borough.' I said it was a big price for so small a job. He said 'Take them over, ask no questions, and here is a couple of sovereigns for you.' I said 'If you make it 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will take them' then he agreed to give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He gave me the key and told me to take them to the Hen and Chickens, an empty house in the Borough. He brought them to me, put them on the pavement and I brought them over. That is the account I give of the possession of them"—Stokes was at the station at that time, but the prisoner had not seen him—Alice Day afterwards made a statement in Henry Wainwright's presence which I took down. (<hi rend="italic">This statement being objected to was not pressed by the Attorney-General</hi>). After that I searched them—I found on Henry Wainwright twenty-seven keys—the parcels were removed to the dead-house at St. Saviour's Church—I took charge of the American cloth and the rope—I have measured the cloth; there is exactly two yards, and the rope measures seven yards or a little over, knotted, cut in pieces—on the same evening I</p>

               <p>went with Stokes to 215 Whitechapel Road—we went in at the back entrance in Vine Court—Stokes took me there and pointed out the door, and with one of the keys that I had taken from Henry Wainwright I opened the door—as you first enter there is a stone flagged floor, and 1 saw a little further on a small chopper wropped in a piece of newspaper, also a spade, a hammer, and an open pocket knife—it is a common pocket knife—I produce it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the axe or chopper, which is a common little axe—I noticed nothing on the knife; on the chopper there was a deal of matter—it smelt strongly, similar to that of the body—this is the spade (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which is a new one; it was marked with lime and clay, covered with lime and clay and some hairs—I think there is some on it now—at the extreme end of the warehouse the floor was raised a few inches higher than the rest; that was the original construction of the floor—I found some boards loose, I took them up and found that some of the joists had been cut—I was induced to look there by finding the boards loose, and also by a smell which attracted my attention to the spot—I took up three of the flooring boards and found that four of the joists had been cut upon which they rested—the joists rested on the earthen floor, they were not fastened to the boards—I saw then that the earth underneath was mixed with chloride of lime—I did no more on that occasion—I put the boards back again, locked the door, put a policeman in charge and left; it was then light—next morning (Sunday) the 12th, I went to the place again and made a further examination—I had all the loose earth removed, and found that earth had filled a grave 5 feet long and 2 feet wide, and 2 feet deep, and I found the mould in that grave to be very largely mixed with chloride of lime—I picked up one lump amongst a number of others as a specimen—I found some hair amongst the earth, and took a specimen of that, it was human hair of a light colour—I have part of it here—I saw the hair that was on the body, and it seemed to me exactly the same colour—I have some of the hair here which I took from the body (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—that portion has been washed since by the surgeon—I noticed that on the flags as you enter by the back door there was a large amount of rubbish on one side and straw on the other—on the part where the straw was it was raised; it had the appearance as if something had been concealed, or as if some person had slept in it, or as if some person had been covered with it—on the other end of the flag portion was about a cart load of ashes and other rubbish—I had the rubbish cleared away from the stones, and underneath 1 found red irregular blotches which appeared to me to be blood—on the ledges of the stone I found marks as if done with this small axe in chopping—there were cuts or indentations in the stone, and a small part was broken away—it had been recently broken, quite fresh—I found a piece of rope underneath the boards on the grave, on the loose earth—it was an ordinary piece of rope with a loop at the end which was cut—that was all 1 noticed at that time; I gave directions to have the place properly searched—I was there about two hours on Sunday morning—Inspector McDonald and detectives Forster and Newman were with me—I have two rings which I received from the detective Newman, also two jet buttons which I received from Inspector McDonald, and two earrings—I have also two jet buttons that I received at the police station from Mrs. Allen in Mrs. Taylor's and John Lane's presence; I have also a pair of boots which I got from a box in Mr. Lane's house at Waltham—I produce a pad which I got from Mr. Larkin, and also three bullets, one from Mr. Larkin,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220015"/>
               <p>and two from Mr. Bond—I also produce a padlock which I took from the door of the Hen and Chickens by direction of the magistrate, and I produce a key of that padlock which I got from Turner on the night of the 11th Sep<lb/>tember—I went to the Hen and Chickens and went down to a cellar below—I found a quantity of loose earth there, I should say at least three cart loads in the inner cellar; that was after I crept through the hole.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. The first words Turner said in Henry Wain-wright's presence were "I think this man and woman have got parcels, something wrong," the parcels were there; it was then that Henry Wain-right said "I don't know what they contained, a gentleman gave them to me to carry—it was after Mr. Larkin made a communication to me that I asked Wainwright's address, and he gave me his address" 78, New Road, Whitechapel, where you will find Mr. Martin"—I was absent about two hours before I came back to the station—I waited at 78 to search the premises—Stokes was not at the station before I went to 78, I found him there when I got back—I have a list of the things I found on Henry Wainwright (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—amongst them I found a pocket knife, it was an ordinary pocket knife—I have not said before to-day that my attention was directed to the loose boards by the smell—I was examined three or four times at the police-court, beginning on 13th September and ending on 13th October—I gave my principal evidence as to my visit to 215, Whitechapel Road, on 13th September—an ordinary con<lb/>stable was placed outside the premises—Newman and Forster were to be in the neighbourhood and to assist in searching—the hair I have produced was found by myself in the grave—I have not shown the stone to any stone mason; I showed the stains' on the stones to the doctors after we had cleaned and swept the rubbish off, they had dried up and were trampled upon and were then scarcely perceptible—I attended all the examinations both at the police-court and the inquest—I showed the earringsto Mrs. Taylor, Miss Wilmore, Mrs. Rogers, and to Mrs. Izzard at the last examination before the Magistrate Mrs. Izzard turned out to be the owner of the earrings—they had been shown to the previous persons for the purpose of identifying them as the earrings of Harriet Lane—I was present when McDonald found the buttons—I believe the burnt ashes in all the grates in the house have been microscopically examined, I gave Mr. Bond specimens of what I found there—McDonald searched the ashes—there was only one rate in the house, that had the appearance of having had a recent fire in it—I have not heard at all that Henry Wain-wright has made a confes<lb/>sion to me, I have not seen a statement to that effect in the "Weekly Dispatch" newspaper; I have not had my attention called to it. (Mr. Besley <hi rend="italic">read the paragraph as follows</hi>:" We understand that the prisoner Henry Wainwright has made several statements to the police which amount to a confession that he cut up the body of Harriet Lane but that he accuses his brother Thomas of being the actual murderer. It is owing to this circumstance that there will, probably, be a change in the form of the indictment against him, whereby the relative accusations against the two brothers will in part be changed, both being accused of murder as well as of being accessories before and after the fact.) There is no truth in the assertion that any confession has been made to me.</p>

After the arrest of Henry Wain-wright on 11th September, I went to 215, Whitechapel Road, I got there about 8 o'clock in the evening—I was there before inspector Fox came—I did not search <hi rend="italic">till he</hi> came—I was present <hi rend="italic">when he searched</hi> and assisted—I found nothing myself on that day—I observed that a board was loose, and I and Foster lifted it up—I went again on the Sunday morning, about 12.30—I found nothing then; I saw Mr. Fox find the piece of rope—on the 16th I examined the loose earth and found this wedding ring in the mould that came from the grave; I put a mark on it, and gave it to Mr. Fox the next day, the mark is on it now—on the 17th I put the mould that came from the grave through a second screen, and as I was seeming it the keeper ring rolled down; I gave that also to inspector Fox; I did not mark that; I know this to be the one; I saw two jet buttons found by Mr. McDonald, on the 17th—on 9th October, I was again on the premises, and again searched the mould from the grave and found a human tooth—on Sunday, 10th October, I went again and then found a kneecap, I mean the bone, and what I believe to be a piece of the scalp with hair on it, and next day the 11th, I found another tooth—I gave them all to McDonald.</p>

I am chief inspector of the H division of police—I went to the premises 215, Whitechapel Road, and searched the ashes that were in the grate there, on 16th. and 17th September, I found in the ashes two jet buttons, about two yards from the grave—Newman put the ashes through a sand sieve screen, and what did not pass through the screen I turned off with a stick, and in turning it over I found these two buttons; I gave them to Inspector Fox; I noticed that the fasteners were in them, and they appeared as if they had been in the fire, they were cracked; the upper part is unbroken—I afterwards searched the upstairs room on the first floor, which is called the kitchen, found I there found two earrings underneath the grate on the hearth, among some ashes—I gave these to Inspector Fox, these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the ashes appeared to be ashes of wood burning, and I found a quantity of small wire in them, as if the backs of brushes had been burnt there—there were a large number of brushes about the place—some teeth and pieces of bone were given to me by Newman; I was present when they were found; I gave them to Mr. Bond, they were part of a kneecap, a piece of bone and two teeth.</p>

I did not go with Newman, on the first night; I went on the Sunday morning, I did not commence the sifting until the 16th September—at that time the mould from the grave had been put into a separate and distinct heap, care had been taken to do that—I think the mould was sifted first, and after that the rubbish heap—the rubbish from the different parts of the house was not brought down an sifted also—that was examined casually, afterwards more <hi rend="italic">strictly</hi>—the sample was taken from the grate; in which these earrings were found, and I gave it to Inspector Fox—he joists were cut on a slope, but at an angle, they dropped in and stood firmly—one or two of them were cut straighter than the others, and the others were cut a little on a slant—I can produce them if necessary—they were cut at each end—each joist would require two sawings to get out the piece; I examined the boards that were over this part, they were not very clean, they were the same colour as the rest of the floor—I examined to see if there were any nail marks, and there were, and the nails were in the boards that were taken up from the floor<lb/>ing, which rested on the joists.</p>

               <p>and nothing more was said that morning that I can remember—I afterwards received this letter from the Charing Cross Hotel by post in an envelope addressed to 6, The Grove, Stratford—I had not told Wainwright where I lodged, because he knew; Mrs. King had told him that I was going there—he had not asked my address at the previous interviews—I received the letter about three weeks after the disappearance, that is after 11th Septem<lb/>ber as near as I can tell—I gave the envelope with the letter to Mrs. Taylor and I do not know what has become it—I took the letter to Mr. Wainwright first at No. 84, the next morning after receiving <hi rend="italic">it late</hi> at night; he was in the shop, I believe, and I said "I have just received this letter, sir"—he said "And so have I"—he took it in his hand and read it, and fetched up one very much like it—he said "I have one very much like it"—he fetched it out of his desk, and I saw it in his hand—I can read writing, but I did not read it; he read it to me—what I saw was very much like this writing—I was near enough to see the writing, about as near as I am to you, but I did not take much notice—he read a portion of it, which stated that he had got the lady under his protection, and it said "I dare you or any one else to interfere, as I intend to marry her"—I don't remember what else it said—I bade him good morning—he gave me this back and kept his own—I am sure I was alone when I showed him the letter first—I took it straight to Mrs. Taylor from No. 84—I cannot say that Wainwright read the letter through, but he appeared to. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "Charing Cross Hotel.

I am quite sure I never received any letter before that—I went straight to Mrs. Taylor and read it to her, and we both went to Waltham to see the father and mother, and returned together—I took no more notice until I received a telegram a few days after<lb/>wards at 6, The Grove, in one of the ordinary envelopes—I opened it and read it, and the next day Mrs. Taylor came to see me and I read it to her, and we afterwards, but not on that day went to see Henry Wainwright together, taking the telegram with me—I do not know whether it was the next day or the day following—we saw Henry Wainright at 84, Whitechapel Road—I said "I have received a telegram from Mr. Frieake from Dover"—I showed him the telegram and he read it—he did not say anything, but he fetched one like it and read it to Mrs. Taylor and myself—I cannot remember the substance of what he read, but he read it to Mrs. Taylor I know and I left her—I saw the telegram in his hand; it was very much like mine—I know telegram paper—he came out with us and asked us to have a glass of wine each and we had it—that was all that passed that day—before I left my lodgings I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance and when it had expired I went again to him—the first 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid after the telegram, and 1 did not go to Mr. Wainwright again till some days over the month, and then I got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for the keep of the children in advance and asked him if he had heard of Mrs. King; he said that he had not—he continued to pay the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance every month up to June, 1875—I took care of the luggage till January—previous to my giving them up</p>

               <p>they were examined at my lodging by Mrs. Taylor and Mr. Eeles, who passed as Fowler—Mr. Eeles opened them—he pushed the lock on one side; it was easily unlocked—I saw the boxes myself; there were several letters in them—I had her letters, she always left them in my charge—they were in another box—after the things had been examined they were all put back and corded up—I did not give the letters up until I received this from Mr. King—this is exactly the writing he used to write to me—I cannot swear that this "Percy King" is his-writing, but it is the writing he always wrote to me—I went to him and asked him if I should give up the boxes—he said "You might as well," and I said "Please send me a paper"—he said that he would do so, and an authority for giving them up was brought to me by Mr. Eeles—I also got one from the father and gave it to Inspector Fix—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Fowler and another young man took the boxes—there was a large box, a portmanteau, and a bonnet box—that was about 21st January, as far as I can remember.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Taylor, a coachman, of 7, Claredon Mews, Hyde Park—I am a daughter of John Lane, of Waltham, who is employed in the Gun Powder Works there—Harriet Louisa Lane was my youngest sister—I can't remember when she left Waltham—I have several other sisters—Mrs. Allen is one of them—I remember my sister Harriet living with Mrs. Foster, prior to that she had lived at several other places in London—she passed as Mrs. King—I knew that she had two children—before she went to Mrs. Foster's at Sidney Square she occasionally came to see me, and my husband and I went to see her—I went more than once, and found she was living there as Mrs. King with her children—the List time I saw her there was the second week in August—that was the last time I saw her alive—at the end of August I went to Weymouth with my husband for a fortnight—an my return I found a letter from Miss Wilmore—I knew that she was a friend of my sister's—in consequence of the letter which I received I went to Miss Wilmore, and then we we went together to see Henry Wainwright—I spoke to him and said I was come about a very unpleasant affair; about my sister being missing—I said "I am her sister, that you can see;" and he said "Oh yes; no doubt of that"—we were like each other—he said he did not know where she was, but that he gave her 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the day before she left Sidney Square, and afterwards, the last time he saw her, he gave her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for an outfit to go to Brighton—he said he gave her that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when she came into his shop at Whitechapel; that he thought she had gone to the Pavilion Theatre with one Teddy Frieake, who had come in for a large fortune; that he waited for them at his shop till 10 o'clock, but that they did not come in—after that interview I heard nothing of my sister for some weeks—afterwards I received this letter from Mr. Wain-wright—at that time I used to speak to him as Mr. King, though I had then found out that that was not his real name—after receiving that letter I and Miss Willmore had a second interview with him—I said "Have you seen anything of my sister?"—he replied "No; but my foreman has seen hour in a cab"—he got a letter and a telegram—he kept the letter in his</p>

At the first interview I had with Henry Wainwright I was accompanied by Miss Wilmore—I said to him "Can you tell me where my sister is?"—he said "I cannot tell you where she is; I only wish I could"—he said "The day before your sister was missing, I gave her 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she said she was going to Brighton?"—he also said he gave her 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for an outfit before she went—it was at that same interview that he spoke of having waited at the shop till 10 o'clock, expecting her to return from the Pavilion Theatre; and that he had never seen her from that time—it was at the second interview that he told me some one had seen my sister in a cab—and at the third interview he said he should not continue to do as he had done for the children, and when the first child was old enough he would give it an education—the children are both girls—on the same oc<lb/>casion</p>

               <p>he said "Should she return again I shall not take to her, can you blame me?"—I replied, "Certainly not, under the circumstance"—all my interviews with Wainwright were at No. 84, Whitechapel Road—I never went to No. 215—when he referred to the letter he held it in-his hand and read it, and I only know the contents of the letter by what he said—I could see the letter sufficiently to see there was writing on it, but whose writing it was I could not possibly tell—I am not certain whether I was the first member of the family who saw the remains—my father and my husband went with me—I had not given any description of my sister to the police before I was examined as a witness—my attention was drawn to the length of the feet and hands—my father drew attention to them and to the hair, as we were looking at the remains together—my attention was also called to the decayed tooth—several teeth were missing when I saw the remains—I had thought before of the particular things to which I would direct my attention when I saw the body—those points were her hair, the decayed tooth, and her hands and feet—the feet were very small, and her hands were also small, with very long fingers—the mark on the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> had not then occurred to me—she had not a scar on each leg, only on one <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>—I am not aware of two—I am quite positive she had not two—I received five envelopes from Mr. Allen and gave them to detective Forster—I am unable to say out of which envelope I took the letter, I saw it before I took it out of the en<lb/>velope—I had the other envelopes with me at the time; the others were empty—I am quite confident that I put the letter back into the same en<lb/>velope I took it from.</p>

               <p>"Well, if it comes to an exposure it must, I know it will be worse for me" I believe I have told all that passed—that was the only interview I had with him—about the beginning of the present year my daughter Harriet's boxes were brought to my house—on 14th September this year I was taken to see the remains of a dead body—I did not see it then, I saw it on the 15th I believe, it was shown to me by Inspector Fox, and some other gentlemen—the body was in portions, cut up—the moment I looked through the glass I seemed to feel that it was my daughter; I recognised her by the hair, and by the legs and feet and hands; I was so satisfied nothing would ever turn me, the moment I saw her—the legs appeared to me to be perfect—the <hi rend="italic">feet</hi> and hands were quite perfect, only very dark, I could not see any natural colour—the hair was just the same colour as my daughter's; she had small hands and long fingers—I don't properly know her height, but as near as I could judge it was 5 feet—there was nothing more that I recognised her by, but the scar on the leg, that I was certain of—I had not seen it of late years; it has never been shown to me on the body, but I made a statement of it—I know as a fact that she had a scar on the leg; I could not recognise which leg it was for some time, but it proved to be on the right leg; I said I was not certain it was on the right leg, but I believed it was—it was some years since I had seen it, it may have been six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years—I was not present at the time the accident happened, but I was given to understand it was done by a poker.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I understood that for some little time she had been a governess after she was out of her apprenticeship—she went to London as I thought to go into business with another young woman when she was out of her apprenticeship—it might be two or three weeks after she had gone to London that I knew she was living in Whitechapel, I can't speak to the time—I never had her address and never went to any lodging of hers—from the time she left home I believed she was provided for—I knew nothing of the pawning of her clothing—I am sure it was in August, 1874, that she last came down to Waltham, either the beginning or the middle of August; it was not the end of July—sometimes six or seven weeks occurred during which she was absent—when Mr. Eeles and I went to Henry Wain-right Mr. Eeles said to him "Here is a letter that has come from Mr. Frieake, the auctioneer"—he mentioned the word auctioneer—Wainright immediately said he was not the man; I think he said that after he read the letter, but I will not be certain—I do not recollect that the conversation was going on at the time he had the letter in his hand, I do not believe it was—he stopped for a time and looked at the letter, and then the conversation went on—I am not perfectly certain, but I believe he was silent at the time he was looking the letter—to the best of my belief I have always said the same—I mentioned the word "exposure" first, but I cannot say at what part of. the story I mentioned it—he said "If it comes to an exposure it must," and 1 rejoined "If it does it will be heavier for you than for me"—I believe Mrs. Taylor is the tallest of my daughters, slightly taller than Harriet I cannot say how much, she is the tallest of all my daughters, but Harriet was not the shortest; I cannot say that she was the next in height to Mrs. Taylor; I have two daughters, I believe, shorter than Harriet; Mrs. Allen is not one of them; I judge her to be nearly the same height as Harriet—I judged Harriet to be more than 5 feet, I never measured her—before I saw the remains I had heard that the features were not recognisable—Mrs. Taylor and I saw them together, I said I was satisfied it was my daughter;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220032"/>
               <p>I was quite satisfied—I had not talked with Mrs. Taylor or anybody as to the particular points to which our attention was to be directed; I went away thoroughly satisfied—the scar on the leg occurred to me directly I went to the police-court and I named it directly—that was the next day, or the day after I had seen the remains—she was perhaps seven or eight years of age at the time the accident happened; I had not seen the scar for many years; I knew there was one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the office of the Charity Organisation at Wandsworth—I am the inquiry officer there—it is part of my business to make inquiries about persons—I have known Mr. and Mrs. Taylor for some years—I saw Harriet Lane once, I knew she was a sister of Mrs. Taylor's—I knew that she was missing in January of the present year—I had a con<lb/>versation with the Taylors about her—they gave me some particulars, in consequence of which I instituted inquires at their request—Harriet Lane knew my right name, and I thought, probably, if the name of Eeles came to her as the name of the person who was making inquiries it might have an opposite effect to what was wished I therefore represented myself to be a Mr. Fowler—I went to see Henry Wainwright at 215, Whitechapel Road, as near as I can say about the 16th January of the present year—I saw him first outside the house; I came up rather behind him, put my hand against his shoulder and said "Mr. Wainwright, I think"—he said "Yes"—I said "I wish to speak privately for a minute"—he said "Step inside"—I said to him "Do you know a person named Mrs. King or Harriet Lane"—he said "Yes"—I said "You have known her about four years"—he said "Yes"—I said "She has had two children by you"—he said "Yes"—I said "Where is she now," or "Do you know where she is," I cannot remember the words exactly, he said "I do not know"—the surveyor for the Sun Fire Office was outside as he told me, and they were going across to measure the premises at 84—he said "Axe you in a hurry"—I said "No"—he said "Will you step across—I said "Yes," and we went across—there was some measuring done at 84, and after it was over we returned to 215—I then asked him when he had last seen Harriet Lane—he said "Some time ago now"—I said "Where do you think she is"—he said he thought she had gone away with a man named <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake, who had lately come into about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; "there are five brothers who had had 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left between them, no doubt they are enjoying themselves and she will turn up again when the money is all spent"—he said that Frieake was an auctioneer—I am under the im<lb/>pression that he said so; I know that he did on a subsequent occasion, if he did not then—I am not quite sure that he said it at that time—I gave him my name as Fowler and my address at the Post-office, High Street, Wands-worth, if he should want to write to me—my impression is that I gave it to him as some sort of satisfaction at the time—shortly after that interview I saw Mrs. Taylor, and she gave me this letter marked E and a telegram—I have lost the telegram—I have made diligent search for it and cannot find it—I have no recollection of having giving it to anybody—I then went to Mr. Frieake of 11, Coleman Street—I saw his address on <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the handbills</p>

               <p>notifying that a sale was to take place at his auction-room, Aldgate—I went there first and then to Coleman Street—I saw Mr. Frieake and showed him the letter that I had got from Mrs. Taylor—I am not quite positive whether I showed him the telegram or not—I had some conversation with him, and he showed me his letter book and some of his writing—after a little time we left the office and went together to Henry Wainwright, 215, Whitechapel Road—I should think that was about a fortnight after my first visit—we saw him and I said to him "Mr. "Wainwright, I have found Mr. Frieake"—he said "Oh, this is not the Mr. Frieake, this is a mistake"—Mr. Frieake said "What is this <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>"—he said "Oh it is a mistake altogether"—this happened outside the house on the opposite side to 215—we then crossed the road and went into the front room upstairs at 215—Mr. Frieake said "You are getting me into a mess that I know nothing of, and may do me a serious injury"—Henry Wainwright said you are not the <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake I mean, the <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake I mean is a billiard player and have seen him frequently at Purcell's, at the Philharmonic, and the <hi rend="italic">Nell</hi> Gwynne"—Mr. Frieake said "Do you mean to say you have ever known another <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake and not enquired who he was; I don't believe you will find another <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake with the name spelt the same as mine in the 'London Directory;' if you know anything about this affair why don't you tell them at once? I saw you with a fair-haired girl a short time ago, is that the one?—Wainwright said "No; I can produce her in five minutes"—he said that he was a young man with no whiskers, and scarcely any moustache, not above a dozen or a score "of hairs—after that conversation I left—I left just before Mr. Frieake, I think—I saw Mrs. Taylor again, and afterwards Mr. Lane—I went with Mr. Lane to Mr. Frieake's auction rooms—I and Mr. Lane at that time had a conversation with Mr. Frieake—he gave me this letter marked A (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in an envelope—I afterwards gave the letter and envelope to Mrs. Taylor—I think the letter was not in the envelope; I did not get the letter back from Mrs. Taylor—when I got the letter and envelope I and Mr. Lane went to see Henry Wainwright, at 215—he was not in at first—we waited for him and he came in after a short interval—I said to him "This is Mr. Lane, Harriet Lane's father"—he asked us to go upstairs, and we went up—Mr. Laue said "Where is my daughter?"—he said "I do not know"—Mr. Lane said "If she is dead tell me, and if alive let me know where she is"—Wainwright said that he did not know where she was, but would do all he could to try and find her—Mr. Lane said "I am determined to find her, if it comes to an exposure it must, but that will be worse for you than us"—during the conversation Mr. Lane was pacing backwards and forwards wringing his hands in great agony of mind—I showed this letter to Mr. Wainwright, told him I had received it from Mr. Frieake, and asked him whether he could give any explanation of it—he appeared to read it, and while he had it in his hand 1 said "Can you tell me what this part alludes to?"—pointing to that part "If <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> and yourself could see me to-morrow evening, we may be able to arrange matters satisfactorily as the time is now very short"—he said he did not know what it meant—he appeared to read the letter, and afterwards (luring the interview he gave it back to me—I do not remember that he made any further remark upon it. (<hi rend="italic">Bead</hi>: "Sunday night. My dear Mr. Frieake,—I trust you will pardon me writing to you, but I feel I ought to apologise for my rude behaviour to you last evening, after the kindness I have received from you.

Should I not hear from you, I shall consider I am not forgiven. I remain, very truly yours, L. King.") I have no means of fixing the date of my second interview with Henry Wainwright—I called upon him after that interview, several times, and asked him about the missing woman—on one occasion he said that one of his workmen had seen her in a cab, somewhere at the West End, but I forget the place he named—on another occasion he said that Miss Wilmore had seen her in a cab, and named the place, somewhere at the West End—he said on another occasion that she would turn up again some day, when the money was all gone—the last time I saw him I made inquiries about her—to the best and my recollec<lb/>tion it was in the early part of July, this year, I think—I cannot find the telegram, Mrs. Taylor gave me, but I read it—it was on the ordinary telegraph paper, I think—it was from E. Frieake, Dover, to Miss Wilmore, 6, The Grove, Stratford—I cannot recollect the date "We are just off to Paris, and mean to have a jolly spree."</p>

I spell my name Frieake, and I am an auctioneer and public-house valuer, with offices at 11, Coleman Street, City, and auction-rooms at 14 and 15, Aldgate—I have been in business about five years, but not at those premises—I have known Henry Wainwright about twelve or fourteen years—I was on terms of intimacy with him for many years, and he used to address me as <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Frieaky</hi>, and other friendly terms—I used to address him as <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>—I have lived at Bow for nearly sixteen years—up to September last I was on friendly terms which him—in September last I received by post this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at my office in Cole<lb/>man Street—I read it, of course, but I did not know the writer, and it was a great astonishment to me—I never knew a person named L. King to my knowledge—I was utterly astonished, and could not imagine what it referred to—as far as I recollect it was received about the 29th, 30th, or 31st of August of last year; it was on a Monday morning—my father was at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220036"/>
               <p>office at the time—I took it home and showed it to my friends, after showing it to my father-for a time it was made rather a matter of joke in my family circle, and then it passed from my mind—I recollect Eeles coming to my office as Mr. Fowler at the latter end of January or the beginning of February—he was alone—he made several, as I thought, impertinent inquiries, and showed a letter—this letter (E) is it to the best of my belief—I recollect Charing Cross Hotel on the top of it—it was signed "E. Frieke," leaving out the "W" and the "a"—I always sign my name Edward W. Frieake—I read it and expressed my astonishment to Eeles; it was not written by me, and I know nothing about the matters referred to in it, or of a telegram which he also showed me—I produced my letter book, and said that he could look at any letters in it to see my writing—I then went with him to see Henry Wainwright at 215, Whitechapel Road—I asked to see Wainwright, and I said "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, I want to see you privately"—Eeles was behind me and Wainwright who met us, ushered us up into the first floor sitting-room—I then said "This individual (<hi rend="italic">alluding to Fowler</hi>) has been to my office and accused me of taking a girl away by the name of King, and has said that you are his informant to that effect"—he said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi>, old man, it is not you; it is another <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake"—I said "Well, it is a very serious imputation to cast upon my character, and should it get to the ears of the lady I am engaged to be married to, it will very likely ruin my happiness," or something to that effect—I said "What sort of man is this <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake, who has represented me"—he said "Oh, he is only a young fellow about 23 or 24, with a slight, black moustache; "I think he said" and a very little whisker, and has lately come into a lot of money"—I then appealed to Fowler, and asked him whether he was satisfied that I was not the man alluded to—before that I asked him where he had known this <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake, and he said at the King's Head billiard-rooms, Fenchurch Street, and the Philharmonic—I asked him whether he had ever seen me at either of those places and he said "No"—I said "Well, it is a strange thing that you should have known another <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake and not have asked him whether he had relations living at Bow, as mine is not a Brown, Jones, or Robinson name"—he said he had principally known him as <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi>—I said "If I had met another Henry Wainwright, and been introduced to him, I should have asked him whether he had any relations in Whitechapel," and that as mine was a very peculiar name I was surprised that he he had not made any inquiries about the said <hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi> Frieake when he first met him, and I turned round to Fowler and said "As far as 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would go I would give it willingly to find out the person who has represented me, as it might be a very serious matter for me"—I said "Who is the fair girl I saw you with a few weeks before or since?"—in fact I had followed them into a public-house—Fowler then left and I had some conversation with Wain-wright alone—I said "<hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, old man, if you know anything about this girl's whereabouts why don't you ease their minds and let them know"—he said "<hi rend="italic">Teddy</hi>, old man, this is a only a get up to extort money from me, the girl is all right"—I think that was all that passed—when I heard of this matter I went to the police-station, Borough, and gave my card, and saw Superintendent Garforth, to whom I gave information—the entries in my diary of this year (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in my handwriting, all but one—from that I have very little doubt that 1 saw Henry Wainwright on 11th September, 1874—he asked me to send a cart down at 6 o'clock on that evening to 84, Whitechapel Road—it would be early in the morning as I passed up to town</p>

               <p>—he was going to give me a sale of surplus stock—I was in the habit of sending carts there—the cart left my office at 6.15 that evening, that is the time it is booked by the carman's bill, until a certain time when he charges me with it; he has charged me for two hours—he was not my carman—he occupied the ground floor of the premises which I occupy the first floor of; he sent the cart away, and it is booked at 6.15 to go to Whitechapel; I do not know where he is now—I never recollect seeing Thomas Wainwright in my life, I may have seen him, there is something familiar about his face, but I never recollect having any intercourse with him—I did not know that Henry had a brother Thomas—I have worn a beard and moustache ever since I was twenty-one or twenty-two—I have my portrait, taken years ago, in my pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. We were young fellows together in the neighbourhood of Bow—that was the commencement of my knowledge of him—I have not been as intimate with him for the last two or three years as I used to be—I have not gone about with him lately, but I used to see his family several nights in the week—there had been no coldness between us, we were on perfectly good terms—the transaction of my selling goods for him was about July or August, at the time of his difficulties, when he was making his composition—the goods were some of his surplus stock—I think the goods were only partially looted when his manager Rogers came and finished them at my rooms—the goods were not considerable in number—I believe the van only went twice for them, and I believe it went in the evening and in the morning; the entry in my diary is Friday, September 11—I made that as soon as entered the office, and I have no doubt that I saw Wainwright on the morning of the 11th, and received directions to take the van there at 6 o'clock—this "evening, 6 o'clock," is in my writing—I am certain that the order was executed, because I have been paid for the cart—the goods were in my possession some time before they were put up for auction, and the fire occurred in November, some six weeks after the sale—I did not act for Wainwright in any way after the fire—I was asked to be a witness by the Company, and also by Wainwright—Fowler came to me in January, 1875—the fire was in November, 1874, and my visit to Wain-wright was early in 1875—I was to be a witness for him in reference to the action against him—I supplied him with an account for the sale, and I have a claim against him, and he has one against me—it is unsettled—he said that Frieake had come into a lot of money, and as soon as it was spent the girl would return he also said you will hear nothing more about it—when he said "This is a get up to extort money from me," Fowler had left.</p>

I don't think I said before the Magistrate that the face of Thomas was familiar to me as that of a person I had fre<lb/>qnently seen in the neighbourhood of Bow, I said that it was a face I had seen at Bow, but could not call to mind—I had seen his face—after this was said about it being an attempt to extort money; I took no further steps, although I said that I was willing to spend money to investigate it—it entirely passed from my memory, because knowing Henry Wainwright as 1 did, I naturally believed him; I am speaking from memory as to the date when I received the letter—I know it was a Monday morning, but have nothing to guide me but my memory as to the particular Monday morning, except the expression in the letter, Sunday night—my young lady called my attention to it where I was on that Saturday evening—that was an</p>

               <p>after conversation between me and the lady I was going to marry—inde<lb/>pendent of that conversation I feel certain it was on a Monday morning, because when this came up I referred to two or three things which still more fixed it—I examined the paper, the envelope and post mark; I carried it in my pocket some time and I taxed my clerk as to whether he knew anything of it.</p>

               <p>the matter to my mind again until I saw the account of this affair in the newspaper—I had never seen the person before, and never saw any more of him till I was taken to the police-court—I don't know that I said before the Magistrate that he had a moustache—it was a very slight one—he did not seem to me to have any beard or whiskers—it was in the afternoon that they came—I was attending to my ordinary duties—I was not in the room with the man during the whole of the time—I asked him in—if my apartments had been let he would not have had the privilege of going into the parlour—I went away and attended to my household work—I saw him go upstairs, because I said at the time "I think you are wanted; Mrs.' King is calling"—I never was in the room within during the whole of that time—the name of Frieake was never mentioned—before I went to the police-court I had heard something about its being alleged that one of the men had passed as Edward Frieake.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Sidney Square, Commercial Road, and have lived there since Christmas, 1873—my daughter Lucy lives with me—I know Henry Wainwright, he came to me as Mr. King somewhere about May, 1874—I had "Apartments" in my window—he came in and said "I see you have apartments here to let; would you mind taking a lady, her nurse and two children in?"—after some conversation I agreed to do so—I said I could not let them at lees than £l a week; he agreed to that—I said "I suppose it is Mrs. King?"—I cannot be positive that he said his name was King, but all his transactions were in that name—he did not say whether the lady was his wife or not, as I know of, but she always passed as his wife; I fancy he said she was his wife; I am almost sure he did—I asked what reference could I have; he said "I can give you a deposit if you wish it, and a reference," he did not give me any reference; he paid me a deposit instead—he said he should not come very often, that he was a traveller, and his business called him very much away from home—he came next morning and said "Is Mrs. King come yet?"—I said "No, she has not been here"—he then left and came again about 11 o'clock with Mrs. King in a cab to look at the apartments—the arrangement was then con<lb/>cluded and she came in the evening with the nurse and two children and Mr. Rogers—they brought their luggage with them—the nurse stayed about seven weeks—Mrs. King stayed till 11th September—whilst she was there Henry Wainright never came to see her; never to come in—I saw him once at the door—Rogers used to come very frequently, and most times he went upstairs to Mrs. King—Miss Wilmore use to come to see her very often, almost every Sunday, and about the end of August she came to stay altogether—whilst Mrs. King was with me I remember a gen<lb/>tleman coming to see her about twice or three times—he went up to her rooms on the first floor; I think one time she opened the door to him herself, or we opened it, and said "It is Mr. Frieake, come in," and he went upstairs—she said she expected a gentleman, and she opened the door, and he went upstairs oh one occasion—once he pronounced his name as Mr. Frieake—I think that was the second time he came, I am not quite certain; but I am almost certain it was the second time of his coming—I let him in both times; I don't think I announced him the first time; I think he went upstairs; I think Mrs. King was looking out. for him and expecting him—I announced him as Mr. Frieake because she was saying in the day time that Mr. Frieake was coming to talk about some furniture, and when he came he said his name was Mr. Frieake</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220042"/>
               <p>—he asked whether Mrs. King was at home, and said it was Mr. Frieake—I first knew about Mr. Frieake because Mrs. King said that there was a gentleman of the name of Frieake going to give her furniture for two rooms, and he gave his name as Frieake when he went upstairs; that was the second time—I think the first time he went up without giving his name—it was when I showed him upstairs that he gave the name of Frieake, and I opened the door and said "Mr. Frieake"—I did not know that he was the gentleman who was going to give her the furniture till he gave his name—I did not know it on the first occasion—it was the same gentlemen that came on both occasions—she said that he was going to get her furniture, not to get rid of it, and she even said that he was coming to get her to choose what colour she would have—on one of the two occasions that he came he brought a bottle of champagne, and Mrs. King asked me for some champagne glasses, and I went out and borrowed some—I saw him bring in the bottle under his arm or in his hand in a paper, it was a champagne bottle I saw it next day up in the room; I think it was a quart bottle—I got the glasses at the Princess Royal, nearly opposite Mr. Humphreys is the landlord, I went for them myself—I got three glasses, only two were used—I saw nothing more of Mr. Frieake that day, he went out shortly afterwards—I think that was the second time he came—on another occa<lb/>sion after that, I can't remember the date, about 10 o'clock at night, there was a knocking at the door by one of my neighbours on account of a little disturbance in the street—I went out and found Mrs. King with Mr. King as I thought it was, and another gentleman, I think it was the same gen<lb/>tleman that came before, Mr. Frieake—I only just saw them with a passing glance—I am certain it was the same gentleman that came with the cham<lb/>pagne—the other gentleman was Mr. King, I am certain—I think Mrs. King was rather intoxicated, she seemed very much excited—I asked her to come in with me, and she said I had no business to interfere with her and her husband, and of course I came in again directly—she appeared to be quarrelling with the gentlemen; they left her on the step of the door and knocked and rang and went away, and she ran down the street after them—I went to the corner and said "Do come in, Mrs. King;" one of the gentlemen was standing on the corner of the kerb, and the other a little distance from him; at last Miss Wilmore went and got her in—next day I gave her notice—I told her I should like her to leave that day week, which I think was on the Wednesday following—she asked me to let her stay two days longer, and I did so, that would be the 11th—champagne was brought on two occasions, once a pint bottle, and once a quart bottle; Mr. Frieake brought it, not the same day, it was some days before, about a fortnight before Mrs. King left, I think, the first time he called—I am almost sure it was the last time he called that he brought the pint, and the other time he brought the quart, he went out for it after he came in—I am almost certain it was the small bottle that he brought last, now I come to think, the first was a large bottle—it was a week afterwards I think that he brought the second one, I know one was a pint and the other a quart—except on this one occasion Mrs. King was a well conducted person, I never saw any<lb/>thing wrong in her—twice before I think she came home very much excited, but nothing to speak of, a little the worse perhaps for a glass of anything—on other occasions she conducted herself quite as a lady, as we thought—once about a month before, she came home about 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening, she had been out the whole afternoon and she was a little more talkative,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220043"/>
               <p>and made herself a little more free with us, that was all—she seemed very fond indeed of her children; they both slept in her bed when she had not got the nurse; before that one slept with the nurse—she left on Friday, 11th September, and she paid me all that was due to me—we parted on friendly terms, we shook hands and I bade her good bye, and watched her round the corner of the street—I never saw her again alive—she had with a small paper parcel which she carried on her finger with a piece of twine, and a new umbrella—I don't know what was in the parcel—Miss Wilmore left later on the same day, with the children, about 6 or 7 o'clock—I saw Thomas Wainwright at the Borough Session-house—I was taken to see him—I had seen him before at Leman Street, but I could not recognise him then, when he was in the Borough I thought he was the same gentleman that brought the champagne; he had very little whiskers at that time—I did not notice whether he had any moustache, I only just let him in at the door as he passed through the passage, and I could hardly say.</p>

It was only after some remains had been discovered which were said to be the remains of my late lodger, and that Henry Wainwright was in custody, that my mind was carried back to the taking of my lodging in April, 1874—I had no reason to think of my lodger from September, 1874, up to the time that the discovery was made; there was nothing resting on my mind—I saw Henry Wainwright when he took the lodging—he came three times altogether, twice the day the apartments were taken, and once before—I never saw him in the house afterwards—I saw him in the cab on the night of the disturbance, that was quite 10.30 at night, at the latter end of August or the beginning of September; it was the same gentleman that had taken the lodging—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said "Mr. King I will go and try and get her in," and she said "How dare you interfere with me and my husband."</p>

I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Old Red Lion, 339, Strand—I was proprietor of the Princess Royal public-house, I and 2, Sidney Square, in August and September—that is immediately opposite Mrs. Foster's—I knew the prisoners—I have known Henry six or seven years, and Thomas four or five years—sometime in the autumn of last year I saw both the prisoners in my house together—the last time I saw them was Saturday, the 5th September—I saw them only once before at the Princess Royal, about a week previously—they were together on that occasion—I fix the date by my day book—I had to give the necessary notice for the transfer of the license, but I do not fix it by that date, but by an entry I made in reference to lending some champagne glasses—I remem<lb/>ber the circumstance, it was on 5th September, and the two prisoners were at my house from 4 to 6 or 7 o'clock, they smoked two cigars and had some soda and brandy divided—my barman in my presence supplied them with a pint bottle of champagne first, and then with a quart, within an interval of half-an-hour or an hour—the pint bottle was taken away, I do not remember who by, but it must have been by one of them because they were the only persons in the private bar—I did not see it taken away by them, but I infer that it must have been; I saw it on the counter waiting to be taken—after the champagne was taken away Mrs. Foster came to borrow some champagne glasses—there must have been two or three, because I made this memorandum to remind my storekeeper that our cabinets were short of champagne glasses—within an hour I should imagine after Mrs. Foster borrowed the glasses, Thomas Wainwright had a quart bottle of champagne which he took away with him and did not return—Henry was not there when the second bottle was taken away—on the same night between 9 and 10 o'clock, I saw both the prisoners outside Mrs. Foster's house, when a disturbance happened, and several other people.</p>

               <p>not seen it since—I was in the habit of going to 215, Whitechapel Road for the purpose of packing goods in the warehouse there—I noticed a smell at the back part of the premises about June—I noticed it for about a month before I left—I called Mr. Wrainwright's attention to it, and told him there was a stench, and asked to have the ashes removed—I thought it came from there—he said he would; they were not removed—it was a kind of faint smell—I could not say exactly what it was—I bought two half-pennyworths of chloride of lime and paid for it myself, and sprinkled it over the ashes in powder—the door leading into Vine Court had two bolts to it and one lock—it was always kept locked and bolted—I used to get in from the front entrance—on one occasion I saw it open when some fixtures were being removed—they went to Mr. Martin's, and they were taken out by that door—I believe that was about two months before I left.</p>

I did not notice the smell after putting down the second quantity of chloride of lime—I did not hear Henry Wain-right give directions for the rubbish and ashes to be removed—they had been accumulating for a long time—there was quite a cartload, if not more—it was all ashes—it was not removed when I left in July, 1875—the Rogerses were living there at the time upstairs, they went out in April—I worked at No. 84, and I had to go to 215 as well—when the Rogerses were living at 84 there were complaints of the smell of the drains at 215—I did not notice any smell at 84 myself—Rogers complained of the smell of the drains at 215 before he went to live there—Mr. West was living there at that time—that was before July, 1874—I am sure it was Rogers who complained, and West as well—I do not know how long West was living at 215—r do not know whether complaint was made of the drains at the time West was there—I never heard of complaints made of the drains at 84—I had forgotten about the taking the case to Mr. Baylis until Detective Forster came to me about the 23rd September this year—he asked me if I remembered it—that was how it arose—I was working at 215 usually, all the time the place was opened—I remember the things being brought from 84 and being loaded at 215 for the purpose of going to Mr. Frieake's sale rooms—I believe only two lots were sent there—I remember a van coming one evening about 6.30, and it came the following morning to take the rest of the things—I was there with Rogers in the evening, when the van came—I do not remember Vostius being there—I did not notice how long it took putting the goods out into the van—we shut up from about 7.30 to 8 o'clock—very likely that evening we may have been later than usual—8 o'clock is my usual tune for leaving work—when it became dark the gas was lighted at 215—it was dark by 8 o'clock in September—we had not the gas alight when the goods were being loaded in the van—we had finished by daylight—we worked by-gas light when it was needed, but on this evening we had finished before we had occasion to light the gas—I and Vostius generally packed the goods at 215—that was the ordinary place for packing the goods—Saturdays were not very busy days—from July to November, 1874, Mr. Wainwright generally made it a practice to clear up on Saturday—he always paid us our wages on Saturday—what I mean by clearing up is getting the place ready for Monday morning's packing—I used to leave before Rogers.</p>

I live at 11, Teddington Ter<lb/>race, Tredegar Road, Bow—I was formerly in the service of Henry Wain-wright—I entered the service the 11th August, 1873, and continued there until April of the present year—during that time he had the premises 84 and 215—up to July 1874 Mr. West lived at 215—from that time until Novem<lb/>ber, 1874, they were not used as a residence—shortly before the fire I went there to live with my wife and continued to live there until April of this year—before going there 1 had been living at 84 with my wife, from July until the beginning of November—I knew Mrs. King; I first saw her at St. Peter Street at Mrs. Wells'—Henry Wainwright asked me to take a letter with some money in it, that was in February, 1874, I believe; he said "Will you take this letter for me to Mrs. King? say it is from Mr. King, there is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, and obtain a receipt"—he did not say who Mrs. King was, the letter was directed to her—I took it there and gave it her—Miss Wil-more wrote the receipt out, and I gave it to Henry Wainwright the next morning—I do not think Mrs. King signed it, it had a stamp on it, I found the stamp; that was the first time I had seen Miss Wilmore or Mrs. King—I think 1 went to that lodging again on two occasions afterwards with mes<lb/>sages or letters from Henry Wainwright—rill usually left them in the tea hour after 6 o'clock—he did not say what the letters were—I remember Mrs. King leaving these lodgings; I went there on that day—Mr. Wainwright told me to go and get a cab to take Mrs. King and the two children to No. 3, Sidney Square, and he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the expenses—that was in the even<lb/>ing in the early part of May—I went to the lodgings as directed, got a cab, and took Mrs. king, the two children and the luggage—Miss Wilmore did not go with us, we picked up the nurse at the corner of the Bethnal Green Road, and then went to 3, Sydney Square, I helped the luggage upstairs and left them there—I saw Henry Wainwright the next morning and told him what I had done—I think I have been to 3, Sydney Square perhaps four or five times with money and letters from Henry Wainwright—I saw Mrs. King there—I took 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one occasion and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on another and gave them to her; I did not get receipts for those I think the last time I took money was when I took the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Mrs. King threw them on the table and said "That is no use to me, as I have to pay my rent;" she appeared dissatisfied—I think that was one evening about the middle of August—I saw Henry Wainwright afterwards and told him Mrs. King was dissatisfied with the amount—he said "Oh, all right, never mind," some short answer, I forget the words—I have sometimes been there without taking money; I was sent by Henry Wainwright to say that he would send it to her shortly—on one occasion the message was that he would send to her shortly when lie had settled his business with Mr.</p>

               <p>after the shop was closed, which was at 8 o'clock; it was brought in a hand truck and placed in the passage by Baylis' man—I saw that done—I could tell by the smell that it contained chloride of lime; it was so pungent—my wife saw it and spoke to me about it—it remained there during the night, and next morning before the shop was opened I saw it lying in the passage—I did not see it removed, and do not know who removed it, or where it went; I missed it while I was upstairs at breakfast, that would be about 8.30 or 9 o'clock; when I came down it was gone—Henry Wainwright came to busi<lb/>ness, sometimes at 8.15, 8.30, 8.45—there were complaints of the drains at 84 while I was living there—no chloride of lime was need for them to my knowledge while I was there—the premises at 215 at that time were only used specially for large orders, sometimes nobody went into the premises for days, only for opening and shutting them, they were opened and shut everyday, and kept open till the time of closing at 84—the shutters were taken down, so that there would be light for any packing that was wanted, but the place was thoroughly closed—the doors would not be open; nobody could get in, we had the keys at 84—at the time I and my wife were living at 215, I noticed a smell at the end of the shop—I could not say when I first perceived it; I should say shortly after Christmas—I put it down to the accumulation of ashes and other vegetable refuse, we had no dusthole there—I spoke about it to Henry Wainwright; I told him the smell was very bad and the ashes had accumulated—he said "When Ladbrooks' men pass get them to clear it out"—Ladbrooks are brushmakers, they used to burn all the refuse in their furnace—they were cleared out on one occasion; I smelt the unpleasant smell again as they accumulated—I only spoke about the smell on one occasion, to my knowledge—at the latter end of July, 1874, Henry Wainwright showed me a revolver; it was in the counting-house at 84, he took it from his desk, it was in a green baize bag; it had five or six chambers, I could not say, it was about 9 or 10 inches long, including the barrel—he asked me to pawn it—he said "I am short this week, I bought it of Sawyer, I gave 6. for it; get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it"—he did not tell me where to pawn it—it had no case to it—I said these sort of things usually had a case of fittings, and I did not believe they would take it in—he said "<hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>, they will"—I then left 84 and took the pistol with me in thegreen baize bag to a pawnbroker in Mile End Koad—I am not sure which pawnbroker it was as there are two close together—I offered it in pledge, but was only offered 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so I took it back to 84, and told Henry Wainwright so; he put it in his desk and I have not seen it since.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—we lived from July to November, 1874, at the upper part of 84, Whitechapel Road—while I was there a young woman, whom I knew as Mrs. King, came to the house to visit Henry Wainwright—I have seen her there on several occasions with him at the end of the shop and in the counting-house, which was at the end of the shop; I have seen her in the shop, I cannot say whether she has remained there—I have seen her sitting in the room with him as I have passed through the shop, but I have not heard what they said when they were together—one evening I heard loud talking, but I did not hear what was said; it appeared to me as if they were quarrelling—the particular evening I am speaking of was about the beginning of September—I heard the talking for some minutes; I saw her go out that night, through the fanlight of the door, and Henry Wainwright followed immediately after—I remember on another occasion hearing a noise or disturbance at No. 84—it was in August, as far as far as I can recollect; I cannot say the exact date—I heard loud voices in the shop, and the words "Don't! don't!"in a woman's voice in a loud tone, and then Henry Wainwright called my husband—the voice was in the shop—my husband went downstairs—it was after the shop was closed, after 8 o'clock—immediately afterwards the shop door shut; I heard it slam, and Henry Wainwright went out, I believe—soon after that the bell rang and I went downstairs and answered the door, and Henry Wainwright came in; but before 1 opened the door I saw the door in the passage which leads to the shop, open—I looked into the shop and saw Mrs. King lying on the floor, but I did not go in, I went and opened the door—'Henry Wainwright came in—i said "Mr. Wainwright, there is a woman lying on the shop floor"—he. said "Oh, is there? she has only fainted; will you give me a little vinegar, please?"—I returned upstairs and brought some vinegar down and saw the</p>

               <p>remembered about the vinegar—I was in the kitchen on the 5th with my husband and the servant—Henry Wainwright called my husband a few minutes after I heard the words "Don't! don't!"—I don't know whether my husband heard the words; he went out and was absent half an hour, or it might not be so much—he was not there when I fetched the vinegar; it was a short time, I can't say how long, between his going down and my hearing the shop door slam; I cannot say how many minutes it was between my hearing the door slam and my hearing the bell ring—there was a light in the shop and in the passage also—Mrs. King was lying a very little distance inside the door—I afterwards went into the shop to take the vinegar, and went close up to her; she appeared to have fainted—I did not notice whether there was any water near—to the best of my belief this was about the middle of August—the loud talking was at the end of August or the beginning of September—I was in a delicate state of health, expecting my second child—the little girl who fell downstairs was my first—the shop used to be closed at 8 o'clock, but our some occasions it was kept open later—I do not know whether Wainwright paid the workpeople on Saturday nights; I was not in the shop to see—I have frequently seen him there on Saturday evenings until the shop closed, he sometimes went out after the shop closed.</p>

               <p>we carried on business in partnership from November, 1873, to January, 1874, as brushmakers at 84 and 215, Whitechapel Road—I did not reside in either of the premises—my clerk, Mr. West, resided in the house portion of 215 till about 15th July, 1874—the partnership was dissolved on 8th of January, 1874—after July 1874 I believe 215 remained unoccupied for some time—after the partnership was dissolved I acted as receiver under the Court of Chancery in getting in the estate—I took possession of the keys of both 84 and 215—I examined the property on the premises; there was a private office at 84 on the first floor—I and my partner had the use of that—I afterwards examined the desks and other things in the office, and in one of the drawers I found a packet of bullets, in a small tin box, or a brown paper parcel—it was in a drawer of one of the pedestal desks I had both keys of that desk—they were conical-pin fire bullets, bullet and cartridge together—I passed them over to Henry Wainwright as I found them—he said they were his—I have not seen them since—I have a revolver of my own; I have here a bullet belonging to it—I never sold a revolver to Henry Wainwright—I should say the bullets Henry Wain-wright took away were a size larger than mine—here was another desk downstairs in the counting-house of which he had the key—he had that exclusively to himself—I allowed him to have that key because he had his own papers there—I never opened that.</p>

               <p>him there—the adjourned inquest was held on the previous day on the 1st—whilst Thomas Wainwright was in the waiting room at the Clerkenwell Court—prior to going before the magistrate he said "I suppose there will be some other charge preferred against me in refer<lb/>ence to the spade and axe?"—I answered "I expect so," and he continued "I was not coming voluntarily to give evidence against my brother, but to save myself I had better speak the truth"—I said "Stop a minute! what you are going to say I will take down in writing, so that there may be no mistake; it may be used in evidence against you"—he then made a statement and I took it down in the book now before me—he said "I bought a spade and wood-chopper, on Friday the 10th September for my brother at Mr. Pettigrews, 181, Whitechapel Road, for which I paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and charged him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he having stated that he wanted it for his house at Chingford"—that was all he said—I showed him the statement, and asked him if it was correct, and he said "Yes"—I then said "I have seen Mr. Pettigrew, and shown him the axe and spade, and he states that you bought them or similar ones of him"—he replied "That is quite right; we went round the corner; Mr. Pettigrew had a glass of brandy, and I had a glass of stout"—when the charge had been dismissed at Clerkenwell he was taken over to the Southwark police-station, and thence to the Court—I received five envelopes <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Mrs. Taylor—one of them contained the letter marked I—this was the envelope that contained it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took out the note and read it—when I had read it I put it back into the same envelope I had taken it from, marked it, put it into my pocket-book, and gave it to Mr. Poland at the police-court—I remember the letter very well—the envelope had the post-mark of the 5th September upon it, and the letter began "Dear Pet"—the other envelopes were also produced at the Court.</p>

That was about 2.30.

               <p>fact that before the second meeting for the receiving a proposal for the debtor Wainwright was in custody on this charge, and afterwards the pro<lb/>ceedings were taken into bankruptcy—I attended the first meeting of creditors at the Bankruptcy Court and was then appointed one of the committee—he was declared bankrupt by someone in the City Road, I believe—the liquidation by arrangement was last year—I was a creditor in that as well as this—I heard that the fixtures that were removed in August were sold by the sanction of the trustee—a portion of them to Mr. Martin—the repairs to the house were necessary to make it inhabitable for Rogers and his wife—Rogers was about at the time and saw me doing the repairs, and he might have suggested as to what would add to the comfort of his residence there—a pane of glass was broken in the window, and a new one replaced it, and all were stippled the same color—before they were stippled you could not see in from the kitchen—there was no difficulty in looking through the window if the glass was clean, no matter what level you were on—if Mrs. Rogers was there, persons might see a figure—I was not examined at the police-court—I was subpoeaned last Tuesday as a witness—I should tell you that Henry Wainwright thought of letting the house, and therefore he did not wish the tenants he let it to to have a view from the dwelling-house info his warehouse—that was the cause of the window being stippled.</p>

I am a clerk in the Bankruptcy Court—I produce the file of the proceedings there with reference to the affairs of Henry Wainright—there was a proceeding for the liquidation of his affairs in 1874, the first instalment in seven days—there was a meeting on 15th May, 1874, at which a resolution was come to to accept 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in seven days, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. within a period of three months, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. within a period of sis months from that time—on 30th June there were proceedings in bankruptcy by a petitioning creditor, and Wainwright was declared bankrupt—those proceedings are pending still—the dissolution of partnersnip was on 10th July, 1875, and Robert A M'Cleaa was appointed trustee.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Red Lion Square—I have made handwriting my study, and I have had a large experience, extending over many years—I have examined letter E and the documents placed in my hands, together with one headed "Statement of Facts," written and signed by Thomas Wainwright—the papers I have before me are the Statement of Facts, numbered 1; a letter from Thomas Wainwright to Mrs. E. Lewis; another letter, signed Thomas Wainwright, dated Wednesday evening, May 29th, 1875; a letter signed "Thomas Geo. Wainwright," which is dated July 26th, 1875, it does not say to whom written; and a letter dated November 21st, 1874, to Mr. George Lewis, signed "T. Wainwright"—I have not seen the memorandum dated May 29th before—those documents are all in the same writing, and there is no doubt in my mind that the person who wrote the letter E wrote these other documents—I can point out a number of instances of similarity between them—letter E, in my opinion, is not dis<lb/>guised, it is in a natural handwriting, and is no doubt the <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> writing of the person who wrote it.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in practice at 44, Trinity Square—on Saturday, 11th September, at 5.30 in the afternoon, I was called in to see the remains of a human body—I was shown two parcels containing the remains of a female—I made a short examination then, and on the Monday I gave some evidence about them—some portions were in a mummyfied state, dry and shrunken, and some in a state known as <hi rend="italic">adipo-cere</hi>, decomposed and moist—the parts had been separated very an scientifi<lb/>cally—the body was divided into ten parts; the head and neck one part, the two hands, two arms, one trunk, two thighs, and two legs and feet. connected—some portion of the pelvis was absent—I noticed that on the first occasion fragments of the pelvis were attached to the thighs, and a por<lb/>tion of the knee-cap was attached to the right thigh—a part of the knee<lb/>cap was also connected with the left leg—at my first examination I noticed the hair; there was dried blood upon it—the body had been recently divided—I could not at that time form an opinion as to how long it had been dead, no more than a long time—I made another examination early on Monday morning, the 13th, before giving my evidence, simply to identify the parts as constituting one entire body—I found that the parts put together made up a body—I did nothing more on that occasion—I made another partial examination on the 14th with Mr. Smith; simply to remove the viscera, and I then observed a cut in the throat—I removed all the viscera except the brain, which was in such a soft watery condition that I could not remove it—I put each viscous into a separate glass jar, which had been thoroughly cleaned out with distilled water, for any possible subsequent examination; they were scaled up and I locked them up in the vestry and kept the key—on the 16th I made an examination together with Mr. Bond—I formed an</p>

               <p>opinion that the woman was about 25 years of age, from the condition of the wisdom teeth; all the wisdom teeth were cut except one, which was evidently being cut at the time—she was of a slender make, about 5 feet in height; the hands and feet were proportionately small with the other frame of the body; I mean they were small for the body—in order to ascertain the height we put the parts as nearly in position as possible, and repeatedly measured them—the cutting up had been done very roughly and very recently—it must have been done by some chopping instrument—I have seen the chopper produced; it might be done by such an instrument—I could not say that a knife had not been used; it might have been used for some parts—there was a very great deal of dirt on the body mixed with chloride of lime—chloride of lime thrown upon a body would tend to pre<lb/>serve the external parts more especially—it is a disinfectant, and I believe it has a tendency to preserve anything put upon it; it retards the decom<lb/>position of those parts with which it comes in contact—its principal agency is to deodorize—I found no quick-lime—we found a fracture of the skull, just behind and nearly level with the top of the right ear; that was an old fracture—on inspecting the interior of the skull we found a bullet in the back part of the brain in the portion known as the cerebellum—that corre<lb/>sponded with the fracture—we could trace the course of the fracture to the place where we found the bullet—we also found a second bullet lying on the base of the skull on a part known as the sphenoid bone, and by tracing the direction of that bullet outwards we found another hole or fracture in the skull, just in front and nearly level with the top of the same ear, just above that prominence of bone which every one can feel, called the zeugmatic arch—one of those bullets had certainly entered the head during life; the one behind the ear—I was led to that conclusion by the extravasation of blood underneath the scalp for a considerable distance around the wound, having a diameter of at least two inches, and also slightly within the skull in the direction in which the bullet had gone—that led me to the conclusion that the bullet had entered the head during life, whilst the circulation was active—there was not so much appearance with regard to the second bullet—there was slight extravasation underneath the scalp—my inference from that would be that the first bullet had pene<lb/>trated the brain during life, and the second when the first had so far pro<lb/>duced its effect that life was fast ebbing—either of those shots was quite sufficient to account for death, not necessarily instantaneously—I have read of a remarkable case where a person might still live with a bullet in the brain—it would not necessarily destroy life instantaneously, but I should conclude that ultimately it would cause death if it lodged there a sufficient time for an abscess to be formed—a person might live till then—it would be enough to cause death, and might cause it instantaneously—we next turned our attention to the cut throat—it was a cut from right to left, just beyond the medial line on the right side of the neck, across the neck to a point about opposite the angle of the lower jaw on the left side—it had severed all the structures from the wind-pipe down to the vertebra—it ex<lb/>tended about two inches upwards and backwards, below, and opposite the angle of the lower jaw; it must have severed the carotid artery; it was too dry to dissect those parts carefully—that cut must have been made either immediately before or immediately after death—I was led to that conclusion by the extravasation of blood in and about the part—the extravasation implies that the circulation is still going on, because had it been done at a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220077"/>
               <p>time very remote from death it could not have taken place, because it would have been congealed; the blood would not have been circulating—it is only while the blood is in a fluid state that extravasation of it can take place—that would be a wound quite sufficient to cause death in a few-seconds, or rather I ought to say in a minute or two—it was an old cut—I took off a pad from the back of the head and took it home and examined it, and in that I found a third bullet, sticking very closely to it; there was an immense quantity of hairpins in the pad—I also took home a piece of velvet ribbon—the hair pins were bent, broken, and rusty—there was an innumerable quantity of them all over the pad, enough to have arrested the passage of the bullet—the pad itself would help to do it, and of course the hair pins also—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pad and the ribbon—the velvet was in a very rotten state, more especially that part which had been saturated with blood—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the three bullets—we gave them to Inspector Fox—I gave the one found in the pad, and Mr. Bond gave the others—this is the one I found in the pad; they are of a different shape—these are the two found in the head; the flattened one is the posterior one, that might be done from the way in which it entered the skull—they are both somewhat out of shape; but the other not so much—the one found in the pad is almost flattened, more so than either—Mr. Bond and I made a little examination of the remains to endeavour to ascertain whether the woman had borne a child, and I subsequently made a further examination myself—I did not minutely examine the hair I took some of it away with me, washed it and gave it to inspector Fox—the washing made it a little lighter, reasonably lighter—I noticed that one tooth was decayed down level with the gum, or jaw and only one, as far as I could see—it was the next behind the eye tooth on the right side—from its position I think it might have been visible when she laughed or smiled—there were some teeth missing—with the exception of the one tooth I should call it a good set of teeth; the remaining incisor tooth at the top indicated that it might have been slightly prominent—I could only see the remains of one ear—I could see that that had been pierced for an earring—I think I have now described the various matters to which my attention was directed on the 16th, when I was with Mr. Bond—I made several subsequent examinations for the purpose of ascertaining whether the woman had borne a child, the result of which gave me a very strong idea that the uterus was that of a person who had been a mother—I should speak nearly as positively now as I should if the body had not been in a state of decomposition—I give my opinion; I won't go further than that—my attention was not at first directed to any alleged scar on the <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>; not until I heard it in the police-court from Mr. Lane; I can't recollect the date; it was when he was examined before the Magistrate—I was there—the body was in such a state from decomposition that it would have been per<lb/>fectly impossible for any one to have found the scar unless diligent search was made for it—after Mr. Lane had given his evidence Mr. Bond and I made an examination for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was a scar or not; we made that examination in the presence of Mr. Aubyn, a surgeon, who was there on behalf of Henry Wainwright; we first examined the left <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>, and then the right, and we found a scar on the right leg, about four inches below the middle of the knee—it was very much puckered; it was an elongated scar, about as big as a shilling the scar itself, but the puckering was much bigger, that is, the way the skin was drawn such a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220078"/>
               <p>scar could have resulted from some hot material; a red hot poker falling on the place would very possibly produce it—I afterwards heard Mr. Lane and Mrs. Taylor examined before the Coroner—I had not said anything about the scar I had discovered before they had given their evidence—I purposely said nothing about it—I think Mr. Lane, before the Magistrate, had de<lb/>scribed it as on the outside of the leg; he thought it was the right—I have seen a pair of boots produced by Inspector Fox—I have compared one with the corresponding foot, and in my opinion it would fit—I went to 215, Whitechapel Road—I saw some remains of stains on the flags; but I could not say what they were; they might have been produced by chopping up the body—I found a tooth in the parcel containing the remains, and others Mr. Bond had given him—both the upper incisors were missing from the mouth, I think the left eye tooth on the upper jaw, and I think both the lower incisors; but they were found and replaced—that left the only missing teeth the left lower incisor and the right upper incisor, they have never been found—I think four were found, two are missing—when the gums are in a dried state the teeth are very apt to fall out—it would net require any violence—those teeth had come out since death—upon a rough idea I should say the woman had been dead from nine to twelve months—chloride of lime would be apt to retard the progress of decompo<lb/>sition—I don't think it would affect the viscera—it would affect the ex<lb/>ternal parts, and I don't say it might not to a certain extent affect the v is cream.</p>

I am speaking roughly when I say death might have occurred from nine to twelve months—it is impossible to give the exact date—when I say extravasation, oozing perhaps would be the correct term—there may be extravasation of venous as well as arterial blood; venous blood will not coagulate in some subjects—I do not know of in<lb/>stances of blood extravagating and coagulating four days after death, or two days—I have not directed my studies to that subject very minutely—the head was in a similar condition to the rest of the body, it was not more decomposed than the rest; it was in an advanced stage of decomposition—I think more of the body was mummyfied than in a greasy state; <hi rend="italic">adipocere</hi> means a greasy state—in the stage <hi rend="italic">adipocere</hi> gases may be evolved; I have not gone into that; I have heard of it, so that the gases may actually be burnt; I am aware by my reading that that is scientifically true—I should not think that the stage is well defined between the period when gases are evolved and <hi rend="italic">adipocere</hi>—I could not say when gases cease to be evolved from a dead body—I have never had such a case as this before; I have never had such an examination to make—I have never examined a dead body in that state of decomposition—I made extensive reports of my examinations, adding piece by piece as I went on—I think I had made about four exami-nations before the scar examination—I think Mr. Bond was present at one or two of those examinations—I did not see him cut out the scar from the leg; I did not see Mr. Aubyn cut out a small portion of the other leg, but I heard him say that he should—he called my attention to the idea that there might be a scar on the other leg, what he said might be a scar—I make no doubt that slight examinations and all, I have made twelve ex<lb/>aminations, either of the remains or portions of them—they were very dirty and dark—a small portion of flesh was left on the right side of the face, but all the soft parts were decayed—the eyes were in a very shrunken condition and sunk to the buck of the sockets—it was quite impossible for any one to</p>

               <p>recognise the features unless it was the cheek bones—I should have thought that chloride of lime would tend to bleach the parts, but have made no ex<lb/>periments to know—the scalp was not entire; a great deal of the back of it was there, but not all of it, especially where the wound was; it was drawn back—there was the most scalp where the wounds were, at the orifice of entrance; but perhaps I am not quite right in saying that at that spot there was more—the scalp at the two orifices was capable of being dissected surgi<lb/>cally, more especially one wound, at the front orifice—the orifice behind the ear was an elongated fracture—the bone was not carried completely away, the back part of it was pressed inwards, but it was not gone; there were very, very slight fragments—the other was perforated and nearly round—some of the bone was carried away—the brain was in such a pulpy state that I did not like to remove it, and in following the course of the bullets I only fol<lb/>lowed the direction of the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, the covering of the brain—I should be guided by a little mark on the skull internally, where the bullet seems to have struck and rebounded—it was by looking at the orifice and drawing lines to the other side, and by the manner in which it had entered the skull that I came to a conclusion—in gun-shot wounds death may arise from a shock to the system or from hemorrhage—I have not studied gun-shot wounds, but I can only imagine those to be the modes of death—I think it is possible that there are instances of a man living sir days with a bullet in the brain—it is quite possible for a person to cry out on receiving a bullet in the brain—I do not know that men have shot themselves through the brain, cried out, and purposely placed themselves in a studied attitude afterwards—if a person had delivered—two, or even three shots within three seconds I cannot pledge myself that death would necessarily result after the first shot—I cannot fix myself to these exceptional cases; I only give it as my opinion that the extravasation being less in one line than the other the lesser one was the more likely one than the more extensive one; I do not say "in one line" but round by the scalp—I cannot say so as a matter of fact, but what I contend is that if the first wound behind the ear had been inflicted shortly after death, or closely after death, I think it would have been perfectly impossible for the bullet to have got so far under the scalp as it evidently had done in this case—the diameter was about 2 inches extending inwards—the extravasation extended 2 inches on the surface to the depth of the 16th of an inch; the adjacent parts were lacerated—I could not point to the exact spot in the scalp where the bullet had got to the skull, because the scalp was retracted—I have formed a conclusion from some exterior appearances and the slight extravasation internally; very slight—I could not say whether the bullet in the head was the first, second, or third shot; it is impossible—the cut in the throat may have been done with an ordinary knife—I am not quite clear as to the extent of that cut into the vertebra¦—why I am inclined to the opinion that the body was that of a person who had borne a child, is because the measurements of the uterus were greater than those acknowledged to be the measurements of a virgin uterus—virgin uteruses of adult women are very much the same in measurement, also in weight and in general size, provided they are healthy—the external measurement of a virgin uterus, including the sub<lb/>stance: the extreme length would be about 2 1/4 inches to 2 3/4 inches, and the breadth about an inch and a third, while this uterus that I examined was, as near as possible, 3 inches, and its breadth about 2 1/2 inches—another reason for my opinion is the thinness of the walls—I should say, taken</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220080"/>
               <p>conjointly, the front wall and the back wall of a virgin uterus would measure about an inch, 1/2 an inch one side and 1/2 an inch the other—there is no cavity; the surfaces lie flat—after child-bearing the walls become thinner, and as near as I could say the measurement of the walls of this uterus were five-eigthths of an inch—I think it is not a fact that the walls get thicker after child-bearing, I certainly shall not admit it; I cannot explain why they should get thinner; I adhere to my opinion; perhaps it is not worth much—another ground for my opinion is, that I have compared this uterus with the several uteri in the museum of Guy's Hospital, both those of the virgin and those of persons who have borne children, and it is certainly inconsistent to think it is that of a virgin, because it is so unlike all what I see there of virgin uteri—another reason is, the condition of the walls of the abdomen—in the state of decomposition it was possible for me to form an inference—I do not give positive testimony to any of it—at the lower part of the abdomen I observed what appeared to be a scarred-like surface, a whitish colour, and lower down the decomposition had progressed very rapidly in between what appeared to be little cicatrices, little scars, and as the surface of the abdomen would be there a little irregular, uneven, I can quite under<lb/>stand that the decomposition would in between those scarred places have gone on more rapidly; that is the only inference—I gather from all this that after a woman had borne a child, of course the abdomen being very much stretched during pregnancy (especially the latter months of preg<lb/>nancy), when the child is born, of course it leaves the abdomen in a flabby condition, and these scars are the result of that, the contraction of the abdomen to a certain extent—this appearance is just as consistent with a person who has suffered in their lifetime from fever or dropsy, but I take it in conjunction with what I have observed else where—if I had had the best opportunity of noticing what are called cicatricies, I should not have formed any different opinion—I met two or three gentlemen with the uteri at Guy's Hospital, once before I was cross-examined at the Southwark police-court—I did not find any hair on other parts of the body besides the head to recognise it—I have not made any experiments as to the effect of chloride of lime respecting its colour—I think it would be a natural inference to find a furrowed finger if a woman had worn a wedding ring for three or four years—I do not say that the hands in this case were unusually preserved; they were certainly not in such a state that you could trace the furrow of a wedding ring—I made a very careful examination for that purpose, but I could not see anything—it might possibly be traced on a fresh subject—the condition of the hand was similar to the rest in its greasy state—the boots were never put on the feet; I judge from the size of the feet, they measured as near as possible 8 1/2 inches from the very top of the great <hi rend="italic">toe</hi> nail to the back of the heel; I cannot say. that the feet were very much smaller than I should expect to find in a person of 5 feet 1 inch in height, but they were not larger, there are plenty of women of 5 feet 1 inch with <hi rend="italic">feet</hi> like that; I have measured the boots, they are as near as possible 9 inches long—I did not measure either hand—the uterus weighed as near as possible 12 drachms, and one source says that a virgin uterus weighs 8 drachms—Dr. Alfred Meadows is an authority who differs; he says in his book from 8 to 12 drachms—I mean the gentleman sitting there, he is an acknowledged authority and the only anthority who bears that out—I have referred to authorities during this examination—I took the measure went of the body from head to feet, independently of Mr. Bond, and as accn<lb/>rately</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220081"/>
               <p>as I could; I made it 5 feet—I do not say that on the supposition of death many months previously and decomposition at that stage having set in, the length would be rather in excess of that during life, but it might be—I can understand that the decayed tooth could be seen if she laughed very much, and in smiling it must have been seen—I do not know whether that is one of the teeth the least covered with enamel, or whether that tooth is the first to decay in fifty people out of a hundred—the two incisors did not project very much, but very slightly—I should not describe the whole of the upper set of teeth as projecting very much, I do not say that by any means; there was nothing extraordinary about the teeth, except that the central incisors were slightly prominent—I have been qualified five years this month.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I live at 50, Parliament Street, Westminster, and am assistant-surgeon to the Westminster Hospital, and lecturer on forensic medicine at the hospital—on the 16th September last I saw the remains of this body at the dead house—Mr. Larkin was present—the body was that of a female of short stature, about 5 feet in height, of slender make, limbs, and body; I thought she was from twenty to twenty-five years of age, and that the body had been dead many months; she might certainly have been dead as long as twelve months-—the hands were slender and covered with a greasy substance; the skin underneath was dry and shrunken; the feet were in the same condition—I think if there had been any deep furrow from wearing a wedding ring I should have found it, I looked to find it and did not notice one; I do not think I could have found a slight furrow—the the hand was a very slight one, the fingers were very thin—a wedding ring would obviously make a deeper furrow on a fat hand than on a thin one—I do not know whether the furrow would remain if the ring was discontinued for a time—the feet were slender and the skin dried, and in the same con<lb/>dition as the hands—I have seen these boots and am distinctly of opinion that they could have been worn by the deceased—I found four teeth absent on my first examination; those in the head were all sound, with the excep<lb/>tion of one, that was the first bicuspid of the upper jaw, which was decayed almost to the bone—I have seen that tooth decayed in persons when they laughed—there was no means of telling whether the mouth was small, as the features were quite gone—in the upper jaw the left wisdom tooth was still uncut; I exposed it by cutting away the mucous membrane—I noticed that the one remaining upper incisor was prominent, when my attention had been called to it by Mr. Aubyn—the marks upon the body where it was cut appeared to be comparatively fresh, but the throat had been cut for a long time; it commenced at the thyroid cartilage, which is the top of the wind<lb/>pipe, the larynx in fact: it commenced at the left ear and reached as far as the angle of the lower jaw from right to left; the arteries and part of the windpipe were severed—I cannot say that that was done during life, but I believe it was, or very soon after death—I believe it was done at a long period anterior to my seeing it; it was a wound which would require considerable force, and it would undoubtedly occasion death—I examined the head and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220082"/>
               <p>hand—Mr. Larkin described the fracture behind the right car; he described it quite correctly—I agree with him that it was an old fracture—I found a bullet in the head—I was able to trace its course from the place where the fracture was behind the ear, and it lodged in the cerebellum—I can say that it must have entered the brain during life—I am led to that opinion by the blood, which was extravasated under the scalp and likewise under the dura mater, which is the lining of the skull—blood was extravasated under the scalp for a circumference of about three inches, and to the depth of about one-sixteenth of an inch into the substance of the scalp—I afterwards found a second bullet in the base of the skull lying on the spheroid bone—I traced the course of it outwards, and in doing so I found a fracture of the skull just at the front of the right ear—that was an old fracture—I formed the opinion that that bullet had entered during life or immediately after death—there was extravasation of blood under the scalp, but not to so great extent as where the first bullet had entered—I form the opinion that the posterior bullet entered first from the greater amount of extrava<lb/>sation, and what is more important, from the extravasation inside the skull—either of those bullets entering the skull and lodging there would in my judgment cause immediate death—it would be quite impossible after the bullet had entered her head for her to have cut her own throat, and if her throat was cut first it would be absolutely impossible for her to have fired the shots—I am inclined to the opinion that the uterus had been impreg<lb/>nated, and more than that, that the woman had borne children, but I believe it is quite impossible to give a positive opinion by the inspection of the uterus—when I examined the body on 16th September I found no scar; no scar could be seen in the state in which the legs then were to the eye of a person unskilled in such matters—I was at Southwark police-court when Mr. Lane, the father, was examined—I heard him make a statement in the witness-box, in consequence of which I made a special examination for the purpose of finding a scar—I examined the left leg first—it was necessary to scrape off the greasy matter first—I found no scar—I then scraped and examined the right <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>, and found a scar on the outer side of the leg, about two inches below the head of the fibula—that would make it about three inches below the joint of the knee—it was a very distinct scar, about the size of a shilling—it was elongated from above downwards and slightly backwards, thick and fibrous—the skin was puckered a good deal in front of it, and was white at the back part of it; that describes it accurately—it was perfectly consistent with the appearance of a burn from a hot poker; that would be likely to have produced it—I cut the piece out—it is mounted—I have it in my pocket—it is mounted (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—the cut which I made goes direct through it—I think the bullets are conical—I weighed them—the first weighed 66 grains; that is the one that entered by the back; the one partially flattened—the second weighed 78 grains, and the third, which Mr. Larkin found, weighed 82 grains—in coining in contact with the bone it would strip some of the lead—I know from ex<lb/>perience that lead is lost when striking a bone—I saw the hair—I went to 215, Whitechapel Road; before I went there I noticed marks of chloride of lime and earth on the remains, and at 215 I found chloride of lime mixed with earth—there were lumps of it—I have been shown a quantity of it picked out by Inspector Fox—I took some of it away and examined it—it was chloride of lime—I did not find any hair in the grave; I saw some on the shovel—I took some of those and compared them with some of the</p>

               <p>hair from the body with a microscope—they corresponded in colour and substance, and in the marking of the medullar substance—I was shown, some hair by Inspector Fox—I examined that in the same way with a microscope, and that also corresponded with the hair from the body—I saw the chopper at the station—it looked dirty, and it smelt very like the re<lb/>mains—I did not notice any trace of dog's or cat's mess on it—that chopper might have been used for roughly cutting up the body—I saw marks on the stone, and a piece of broken stone, and there was a faint outline of smears—the marks on the stone were undoubtedly recent bits chopped off the edge, and one piece chopped off one large corner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. In the process of decomposition gases are evolved very soon after death; I believe to such an extent that flame can be kindled with them, sometimes in a much shorter period than a month or six weeks, sometimes in two or three days—I am of opinion that the remains were those of a woman who had borne a child, because the cavity of the uterus was large in proportion to the thinness of the walls; that was my reason then for that opinion; there were no indications to lead me to a contrary opinion—I have since had another reason for thinking she had had a child; I have had the uterus soaked and it has swelled to at least three times the size that it was when I first examined it, and now the walls have become very much thicker and the whole organ heavier and larger than the healthy uterus of a virgin; the inference I draw from that is that the uterus was then about its proper size; when I first examined it it was exceedingly shrunken and dry—I differ from Mr. Larkin that the bearing of children thins the walls I think it thickens them—the soaking process commenced after my first examination, after the first evidence at the police-court and after I was examined at the inquest, within—a day or two—Mr. Larkin soaked it; I did not—he told me it was soaked in spirit and water—I saw it in the spirit and water—I believe it has been kept there ever since—I did not measure the walls before the soaking process, they were very thin, a little thinner than thick brown paper—I have measured the whole uterus since the soaking process, not the thickness of the walls—my measurement of the whole uterus was just over 3 inches long, and the width about 2 1/2 inches, and the thickness over an inch—the wisdom "teeth sometimes come late in life, sometimes over thirty years of age—I think it is impossible to fix the age of the person whose remains these were within ten years—I don't know that the decayed tooth is the one with least enamel and most subject to decay—I had an impression the other way, that the wisdom teeth were the first to decay, the last to come, and the first to go; such has been the case with me—chloride of lime takes away some colours—I don't know that it will take away colour from hair—I would not say it would not, but I don't think it would—it would take it from unstable colours—it undoubtedly retards decomposition—I was present when Mr. Aubyn took a piece from the other leg; I looked at it as he held it; I saw him cut it out; I examined it as he cut it out and as he held it in his hand; I am quite prepared to say that it had not a scar—I measured the height very exactly several times; I did not make her quite five feet; I made her 4 feet 11 inches and five-eighths; I think it was not one-eighth—if you will allow me to refer to my notes I can tell you <hi rend="italic">referring) I</hi> beg pardon, I was wrong, it is 4 feet 11 inches and one-eighth—I think the fact of death having occurred so long back as nine months would not lengthen the height; it would shorten it; I don't think to any great extent;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220084"/>
               <p>it might to the extent of an inch; I was of the same opinion at the police court—I made four examinations altogether—the cut in the throat was done with great force—I am most undoubtedly of opinion that it was done by some other hand than that of the individual whose remains I saw—I cannot pledge myself to what period of time after death that injury was inflicted.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I say that the deceased could not have fired the two bullets into the brain and after that cut the throat, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, she could not have cut her own throat and then have fired the bullets into the brain—the force with which the cut was done is one reason why I say she could not have done it herself, and another reason is the direction it was not a direction in which a suicidal wound is caused; it has scarcely ever been found except in the case of a left-handed person; a person would not cut up in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>); they would cut downwards with the right hand; the cut was carried deeply in under the jaw; it must have been commenced in the medial line; what I say is that, from the position of the cut, it could not have been done by the person herself unless she was left-handed; I have a very strong opinion that it could not have been inflicted recently, because of the retraction of the tissues and the great dryness of the tissues quite down to the bone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I could not say positively at what date it was done—I say positively that to me it appeared not a recent cut; it was quite different from the other cuts I saw—as to a positive opinion, it is not for me to give it—when the muscles and ligaments are relaxed shortly after death, I believe persons measure more after death than in life—I have never actually found the measurement longer myself—I have not had occa<lb/>sion to do so; but I think it would be the reverse after the drying of the tissues—I think the inter-vertebral ligaments would shrink and the liga<lb/>ments retract—I am not able to give a definite opinion as to that from experiments, but I can tell you as a fact that all these tissues do contract—I know as a fact that immediately after death they relax, and retract when dryness takes place—I have not had occasion to examine remains in such an advanced stage of decomposition for the purpose of measuring height—I have disected bodies much longer decomposed, but I did not know them in life or measure them in life.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I had some difficulty in put<lb/>ting the parts together so as to measure accurately—I was guided by the exact anatomical position of the parts—it is not on easy thing to get them exactly placed in position—I did it to the best of my ability—in the condition of the body that I examined the ligaments are contracted, and the inter-vertebral cartilages must have contracted from the extreme dry<lb/>ness, in fact 1 cut out the vertebra, so I know as a fact that they were con<lb/>tracted and dryed; I think it might make the difference of an inch—the wisdom teeth usually appear from 20 to 25, and even earlier sometimes—as to the cut in the throat, I cannot say whether it was inflicted during life, or im<lb/>mediately after death—there was nothing to lead me to tell which—there was nothing to lead me to say that it was not inflicted during life—there was blood around the cut, but I can't say that that blood came from the cut—it might have come from the gunshot wounds—if I had seen blood in the cut I should have said that it must have been done during life, or otherwise before the circulation had ceased—the cut extended just to the left oar, and the ear around that particular part was exceedingly much clotted</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220085"/>
               <p>with blood directly at the end of the cut, but I cannot tell whether it came from the cut or the other wounds—the blood from the wounded head might have flowed over—if I could have traced the blood to the cut and nothing else, then I should have been certain that it must have been in<lb/>flicted during life, or before the circulation bad ceased—I saw no blood in the cut; the cut commenced on the right hand side, in the cartilage, and it went deeper and deeper until it got very deep, quite under the angle of the lower jaw—in my opinion it was a cut upwards, because the only way <hi rend="italic">to make</hi> it downwards would be quite to make a slanting cut under the jaw and then draw it down, which would be a very unlikely thing to do; in my opinion it went from the center of the throat up, under the left angle of the lower jaw, going deeper as it went on towards the left ear; the head was severed from the trunk lower down, underneath the cut; the cut had nothing to do with the severance from the trunk—there was greater extra<lb/>vasation below the scalp where the first bullet had entered, and below the dura mater than the other—I think the pistol-shot wound would produce death instantly—if it did, that would account for the less quantity of extravasation from the other wound.</p>

The heart would probably stop within a minute when death was caused by the shot—I have said that it is difficult by the inspec<lb/>tion of the uterus after death to form an opinion whether a woman has borne a child or not; but I should expect after child bearing to find the walls of the uterus thickened—that would <hi rend="italic">give</hi> me some material upon which to form a judgment; thickened walls is compatible with child bear<lb/>ing, but it is also compatible with inflammation of the uterus or other diseases of the uterus, therefore it would not be a safe inference—I should expect to find general enlargement and thickening of the walls of the uterus—I think no reliable judgment is to be formed as to whether a woman has had more than one child—I think that is impossible, because I do not believe it makes the slightest difference to the uterus whether she has borne one child or two or three—since the parts have been soaked they have become much thicker than they were; but I do not say much thicker than in a virgin uterus—the walls of the uterus of a woman who has borne children are not much thicker than a virgin uterus; but they are thicker—in my judgment it was impossible to form a confident opinion as to whether this woman had had one child or more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Physi<lb/>cians, a lecturer on midwifery at St. Mary's Hospital, and physician to St. Mary's Hospital—I have made obstetrics a considerable subject of study—I was present in Court yesterday during the examination of Mr. Larkin and Mr. Bond—I examined the uterus at my house on the 3rd September in order to form some opinion whether that uterus was that of a person who had borne a child—the points are principally two to which I look for the purpose of forming that opinion to determine the question, and they are the size and as to the cavity of the walls, but more particularly the shape of the uterine walls; the walls in the present case were exceptionally thin, instead of being, as I should expect to find them, somewhat thicker than an unimpreg<lb/>nated uterus—at the time I saw the uterus it was in a liquid of some kind, I believe spirit and water—with regard to the second point, I found the walls of the uterus projected in a convex manner into the uterine cavity—it is not possible to express any distinct opinion as to whether the uterus had had been pregnant or not; my opinion, considering the points mentioned, is that the uterus had not been pregnant—it is not possible, with any accu<lb/>racy, to form an opinion as to the age, owing to the decomposition and the long time the body is supposed to have been buried—chloride of lime is called a decolorer I have no experience as to its effect—I think it possibly might reduce black hair to a light shade—it would undoubtedly have a bleach<lb/>ing effect.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I did not examine the body of this woman at all—I should probably endeavour to find out the age by the teeth; I am not aware that it could be found out in any other way; wisdom teeth make their appearance from twenty, perhaps a little before, to twenty-five or twenty-six; they vary a good deal—I am not sure that I should come to the conclusion that a woman was not over twenty-five if I saw her dead body and from whose jaw the wisdom tooth was just protrud<lb/>ing, probably I might—I do not think it could be stated with certainty that the uterus of a woman recently dead had been impregnated—the walls were convex, which is certainly not due to the muscular degeneration—there was muscular degeneration <hi rend="italic">very</hi> considerably; the whole mass was very flaccid,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220087"/>
               <p>but not at all difficult to measure; I measured it—the uterine cavity was 2 1/2 inches—I only speak of two measurements, the other was one inch and a third in depth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">He-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I measured each wall separately; the ante rior wall was a little under a quarter of an inch, and the posterior wall a little over a quarter of an inch—I should expect to find the uterus of a woman as large twelve months after death as just after—I have not had practical expe<lb/>rience of the inspection of a uterus twelve months after death, but I have had experience of the examination of the uterus in bodies a few weeks after death, and I am able to express an opinion that the measurement would be the same after the lapse of twelve months—I think there is no shrinking of the uterus after twelve months, probably there may be of the whole body—I think as regards the uterus it would be infinitesmal; a virgin uterus is subject to considerable variations, even in what we call the normal state—if a body shrinks, the uterus might participate to the extent of sixteenth of an inch, which I think would be a fair proportion, because it has been found that after the womb has been developed it very seldom returns to its original shape again; it is exceptional if it does; I was not speaking of it as an invariable rule, but it is regarded as an indication of a nulliparous uterus—I do not know in what way the uterus had been treated when it was taken from the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and practice at 519, Commercial Road—I have been in the profes<lb/>sion about eighteen years—I was desired to inspect the remains of the deceased woman by the solicitor for the prisoner on the 24th September, and attended with Mr. Bond on the next morning at 9.30 to do so at the mortuary at St. Saviour's Church—we examined the body three or four times; it was in a very advanced stage of decomposition—from examination, I should think the age was from twenty-five to thirty, not more, I judge by the sutures of the anterior part of the skull not being invisible; after thirty we expect to lose them, we cannot say to two or three years—I examined both the legs—the scar produced, is the one discovered on the right leg below the knee—I discovered also a scar on the left leg which I cut out (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I cannot say what it is the scar of, but from some injury, where it has been struck on this part, or it may have been from a burn—I think the skin has been destroyed—the scar is about the size of a shilling; I will swear posi<lb/>tively that it is not the result of decomposition, but in my opinion it is a scar—I examined the mouth; there was one bicuspid tooth decayed down to the bone, and some others were missing—I would not give an opinion upon dental surgery, nor whether that tooth is one that decays sooner than the others—I examined the uterus with care, for the purpose of forming an opinion whether the woman bad been pregnant or not, and the signs to which I looked were the length and the size of the cavity, the general appearance of the womb, and the thickness of the walls—I also observed the shape with Dr. Meadows—I do not give a decided opinion as to the having been pregnant, but my opinion is that she was not pregnant, that the womb hid not been gravid, that she had not borne a child—I examined the hair; I did not detect any curl in it; I produce it—I took this off the back of the head myself—it was all hanging down when I saw it, and I took it off at the last examination from a piece of the scalp behind, which was loose—this other piece which has been produced was, I should say, taken <hi rend="italic">from</hi> near where the hair pins have been; it is of a lighter colour and my probably</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. I come to the conclusion that the deceased must have been 25 or 30 because we generally find the anterior sutures of the skull disappear from 28 to 30, and they had not dis<lb/>appeared, only at the posterior part—the wisdom teeth appeared as I should have expected them to appear; but Mr. Bond told me that he had cut through the gum and made one appear, and I only saw it afterwards; but in such a disputed question I cannot give an opinion—if the tooth was just making its appearance she might be 25 or 26, it is sometimes earlier and sometimes later—wisdom teeth vary in the time they make their appear<lb/>ance, but they usually appear from 20 to 25 or 26—I take my opinion that this woman was at least 25 years of age from the condition of the skull, because the anterior sutures had not disappeared—after 25 you lose the posterior sutures, they had gone, but not the anterior ones the posterior I could not detect, but the anterior I did—there is always room for varia<lb/>tion with age in all these cases, especially in the condition of a body like this—the sutures disappear altogether about 30; there is just a mark by which anatomists can detect them, but not ordinary persons.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said just now that the posterior sutures disappeared at 25 and the anterior at 30; do you abide by that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made a mistake the posterior longest and the anterior shortest.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. The anterior disappear first—that is so—the posterior sutures remain for a long time; the anterior disappear at an early age, they go earlier—after the age of 24 or 25 the anterior set go, and the posterior are left—the anterior sutures disappear at the age of 24 or 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the anterior sutures disappeared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You have just asked me that question. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you again; had the anterior sutures disap<lb/>peared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the anterior had not disappeared. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the posterior sutures gone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they had not—I came to the conclusion that she was 25 because I take the sutures as my guide—I base my evidence on the sutures and on the teeth—I know nothing about the teeth except what I was informed by Mr. Bond—he said that he had cut down to one of the wisdom teeth—I understood him that one side of the tooth was through and the other not, and I started from that and said that the woman was 25 years of age—there is no particular rule for the wisdom teeth making their appearance, but I came to that conclusion because she had cut one—I did not hear that she had cut three and that this one was not cut; I only sup<lb/>posed she had one through—the others were through and she had one to come—I have no other reason to give you why I say that she was from 23 to 30—I only found the scar on the right leg on the last examination—I conducted that (examination with Mr. Larkin and Mr. Bond—we scraped both legs, and on the first examination we could not find the scar, but we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187511220089"/>
               <p>did on the second—we scraped the leg before we found it—we scraped the legs on the first examination but did not find a scar on either, but we did ultimately find one a little below the knee on the Tuesday—I have no doubt about it being a scar, and I think it might have been produced by a burn—we did not discover it on the first or the second examination, not till a fortnight afterwards, the day before the remains were buried—they had then been removed to a dark vault under the church, and we went down with a lighted candle—I did not notice whether we had one or two endless—I did not notice dark patches here and there, but there was one patch on the leg which struck me, though not till the day before the body was buried—Mr. Bond looked on the left <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> and I looked on the right—I did not look at the left leg till the nextexamination, and then we had two examina<lb/>tions before we found either of the scars—we cut out the piece of flesh containing this scar—I will not swear what the scar was produced by—if the woman during life had received a blow on her leg she might have had a scar—a blow inflicted on the leg would produce such an appearance if it suppurated—I will not swear that this is not an appearance produced by decomposition—I examined the uterus with Dr. Meadows.</p>

I should have given it to him—I think I have paid part before the work was delivered—I think you will find that the two amounts in the cash-book were sufficient to pay both these bills—the next payment was on the brush—my clerk looked nearly all night for the bill for the large van and could not find it, and I have tried to find it myself—I do not know whether I had a bill—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill for the work done in June which was delivered on the same date as this one of 29th August—I did not produce these two bills before, because they were both shut in the books—all these things were paid for at the time, we never let a thing like this 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stand; it would not be entered—I do not say that we never enter such amounts, but in this cash-book it is very rare—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the whole amount due from me on 4th September, and this 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account was the whole amount I owed him at that time—that included everything up to that time, and the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for repairs to the big van and the work done to the little van—we have thousands of papers in the course of a day, they are kept on a large file; we have searched three or four large files on several occasions to find the bill I paid Mr. Wiseman—we probably did have a bill for repairs of the large van—I do not usually hire vans when my own vans are being repaired, I do now, as we are busy—if my vans were being repaired I should make shift with a one-horse van till mine was repaired; he would not keep it more than a day or two—Mr. Wiseman has been told by me always to take his money as soon as he has done his work—I don't suppose I should pay him for it until I had seen what he had done to it—I probably paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. because 1 saw what he bad done to it, I only speak from my books; I have no memory of the transaction—the small van did go several times, it did two loads on 10th September, and the big one one load—the small one would hare to go, I suppose, 3 miles, it was generally used for all purposes, taking out corn and all small loads, but it would not carry 116 bags of rice at the same time—I had the little van oiled in September; it was generally paid for when done, it was only a shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger of 291, Oxford Street, close to Davies Street—I know Thomas Wainwright—he entered my service as shopman on March 30, 1874, and continued with me until the 10th October—I employ various countermen, and I have a sheet on which are entered each day the takings of each counterman—I have the sheet here—each counterman enters into a separate column his sales—during the time Thomas Wainwright was in my employment he was very regular, except</p>

               <p>that he was late in the morning—he was absent four or five days, which by reference to my sheet I find to be May 11th; Monday, June 22nd; August 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 13th; and October 7th—August 3rd was the Bank Holiday; the 4th and 5th were holidays I gave—while he was away in August, I received a telegram from him from Ramsgate, dated August 3rd, asking me to let him stay another day—he was not late every morning, but usually on a Monday—he ought to have been at business at 8 o'clock a.m.—he left at 8 o'clock p.m., when my shop closed—we begin to take in goods from the door at 8 o'clock, and in about ten minutes the shop is closed, unless there are customers in the shop, when it might be a little longer—he generally got away at 8.10 or 8.15—during the time he was in my service he wore a full dark moustache, but no beard or whiskers—I am not a locksmith, but I deal in locks—this is about a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. padlock—they are made in large quantities, and it would be extraordinary to find a key that would not fit it—there is no doubt this key fits the lock best, but even that I should not call the proper one—I am not sure that it was not intended for the lock, but either of them will do equally well.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. Both would do because both will open it—my shop is on the further side of Oxford Street—I don't know whether Baker Street or Portland Road Station of the Underground Railway is the nearest to my house—Thomas Wainwright was engaged as manager, but I used occasionally to send him out—I don't seek orders out of doors—he used to go out occasionally and collect debts if they were difficult to get hold of—I had four countermen at the time he was with me, including him—I believe the same countermen were with me from March till he left me, but I should not like to swear it without looking at the sheets—the sheets are placed on a desk, and it is the counterman's business to put the cash down in the column assigned to him—if Thomas Wainwright's writing is on the sheets I know that he was there—these are the sheets for the whole of September (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—"W" represents Wainwright, "Alf." represents Alfred, one of the other countermen, and George Lewis was another—on this sheet of September 1 both these columns are entered for the first counterman, the next column is the money received, shillings and pence—Thomas only sold five articles on September 1—I should infer from that that he was absent in the morning, because there is an entry here which I do not remember, "store edgings"—they were supplied to a publican opposite; the order he took himself, and I remember distinctly the money being received just before we closed in the evening—that would be from 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock—on 5th Sep<lb/>tember Thomas appears to have sold only a few articles compared with the other countermen; but that was Saturday, and we then close at 5 o'clock—Alfred has sold a column full of articles that day and Wainwright only seven; so he must have been engaged in the window, or else he was out, and if he was dressing the window, which is a difficult task, he would be left entirely undisturbed, and would not have much to do at the counter; sometimes we have a general clear out, and it takes two or three hours to dress the window—we should be more likely to dress the window on a Saturday, because it is a slack day; or Wainwright might be out or he might come late—I never had his equal as a salesman—there is one counter, and it is—30 feet long—on 10th September Thomas is down thirteen times—his sales seem to have been equal to Alfred's, and I should say that he was there all day—it was a full day and possibly it might have been wet—September 11</p>

               <p>was a worse day as far as the till was concerned—there are small matters which we do not pretend to take notice of, such as pence, and he would be doing his window when he had not customers to serve—he made ten sales on September 11, amounting to 46<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; more than double any other man's—on August 13 he was away altogether; but you will find he was there on the 14th—he was living somewhere at Fulham; but I do not know of my own knowledge—I discharged him for two reasons—he had been very irregular of a morning, and it came to my knowledge that he had deserted his wife—I never spoke to him about living at Parson's Green—I did not know it—I never spoke to him about Mrs. Raper—I do not know The Rosamonds at Parson's Green—he never told me that he lived there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of the Supreme Court; formerly I was an attorney—my offices are 13, Railway Approach, London Bridge—Thomas Wainwright was a client of. mine—he came first to con<lb/>sult me in February, 1875, at which time he was about to open the Hen and Chickens—I was employed to draw up an agreement between him and Mr. Moore, but it was never completed—the lease was not executed in consequence of Mr. Moore not carrying out his part of the agreement—the partnership fell through—after the failure of the business at the Hen and Chickens I was consulted by Thomas with regard to the surrender of the premises—I corresponded on the subject with Mr. Stuckey, the solicitor for the lesser at Brighton—I had but one interview with him; that was about the 9th or 10th of August—I believe no rent had been paid for the Midsummer quarter, and Mr. Stuckey wrote to me and said that if he accepted the key the quarter's rent and the costs of the lease should be paid—I have experienced in such cases that by the time a second quarter's rent is due the difficulty disappears, when there is nothing to distrain—the earliest time at which I was spoken to about the surrender of the premises to Thomas Wainwright was the beginning of August, or it might have been the last few days of July—I met him in the street, and he spoke to me about it.</p>

               <p>and be asked me for samples; but I did not offer them to him—I may have given him some—I did not press these very teas upon him—I called on him perhaps half a dozen times—that may have been to ask for orders—when I met him on September 8th I knew that his petition had been filed—I do not know that at that time he was unaware of the position of Hebden Westwood—he did not tell me so, but I saw it in the paper—I think he said something about having ascertained what his position had been with reference to Mr. Hebden—after I saw the bankruptcy published I pressed him on my own responsibility to obtain a guarrantee from some friend to pay this money, and told him that if he did not do so it would be very awkward for him.</p>

I am landlord of the Royal William public-house, Essex Road—from about 11 o'clock to 11.30 on the night of the 21st October the prisoner was at my house, and tendered a bad shilling in pay<lb/>ment for some rum; I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and afterwards he had some more rum, for which he also tendered a bad shilling—while I went out of the bar to call the barman, who was asleep, prisoner went away—he tendered me a third shilling which I took to be bad and I did not give him the change; but about ten minutes afterwards he demanded the shilling or the change—I followed him into the street, and he was ulti<lb/>mately given into custody—I marked the two shillings and took them with me to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know whether the prisoner had the third shilling, but I gave it to a customer to inspect and did not receive it back—prisoner struck me, and put the shilling into his month just as he did so—he did not test it and say it was good—I did say at the police court "The third shilling had been taken from my hand and the prisoner has put it into his mouth"—I marked a shilling which I thought was the third, but which I afterwards found was good—I heard the prisoner say "I did not know that they were bad, but if so I must have taken them on the racecourse."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police officer attached to the post-office—on 4th November about 2.30—I went to the north-western office and saw the prisoner in the post master's room—I showed him this letter addressed to Mr. Wootton and said "This letter was seen last evening to drop from your trousers leg on to your boot and then on to the floor by one of the officers"—he made no reply—I said "How do you account for that?"—he replied "I deny it; I know nothing about it"—I searched him and found a hole in the bottom of his right hand trousers pocket 4 inches long, large enough for the letter to go through, if doubled up.</p>

About the second week in October I received certain communications from the French police authorities, in consequence of which I, in company with Davey, went to the house of the prisoner—I talked with him in the back parlour while Davey made the search—I told prisoner he must consider himself in custody—he replied that any one might possess the machines he had, which were for the manufacture of Oriental necklaces—I searched him and found a pocket-book and some platinum clippings—he begged hard for the pocket-book to be resumed to him, and asked if he were imprisoned what would become of his wife and two children; he referred to her afterwards as his companion; he also inquired whether she had been arrested in London, or New Haven, or Paris, stating he had sent her to the latter place for some articles for the manufacture of Oriental necklaces and the Queen was so much liked all over the world that. her profile stamped upon them would be the best—I took him to the police-station, where he gave the name of Raymond Joseph Laving—I found in the pocket-book amongst others a letter dated "London, October 6th, 1875." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not very well know that he had not a wife, nor of her arrest in Paris—I knew of her arrest when I made the search—I did not know he was a widower—I made no demand for the pocket-book, I searched him and took it—some of the letters were from his daughter, which I gave him back—I believe she is in a situation as governess.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Frederick Jones—I recollect Emmings coming home to live with us about four months before my little sister died—I used to attend to the children—I sometimes had food to give the baby and sometimes not—there was not enough for the baby—I did not ask anyone for food—sometimes went without it and sometimes Mrs. Barton, a neighbour, would give me some—Mrs. Emmiuga went out to work and I had charge of the child—I had not enough food to cat—I sometimes said something about it to my father—he used not to say anything—the child seemed ill—my father saw it—he used to say it looked very bad.</p>

               <p>that was brought in—sometimes they brought enough sugar to last the week—sometimes there was plenty of bread in the house—I don't. know how much a week was paid for bread—I fed the baby myself when there was food and Mrs. Emmings fed the baby—my father was sometimes kind <hi rend="italic">to the baby</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fed it</hi>—he seemed <hi rend="italic">sorry</hi> at its looking so ill.</p>

I practice at Fulham—I attended Jones' wife after her confinement last November—she died of consumption—I forget when—I saw the child at that time—I didn't take much notice of it—there was nothing to draw my attention to the fact that it was ailing—I believe I saw it some days after it was born—it was an ordinary child—I made. 1 <hi rend="italic">post-mortem on</hi> Saturday the 6th November—I found the child attenuated to the last degree—there was not a particle of fatty matter over the chest or" abdomen—the Organisation generally was healthy—I examined the lungs particularly for traces of phthisis or consumption, which were absent—there was no trace of disease of the lungs—I also examined the mesenteric glands, in which phthisis generally takes place in children; they were shrunken, hut healthy; no sign of consumption—there were some old standing Adhesions, showing that there had at the same time been chronic inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">peritonaeum</hi>—the peritonaeum itself was completely devoid of fat—is a rule, it is very fatty—the cause of death was improper and insufficient food—I do not think I could say starvation—not enough; I am quite open to race the cause of death to that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). Sergeant Morgan and I received certain instructions with regard to the premises of Messrs. Hill, army tailors, and watched them in consequence—on three occasions I saw Chelraick leave and go to Laventhall's house, 8, West Street, Golden Square—on Thursday, 28th October, I followed Chelmick to her shop, where he handed her some silk—I ran in and said "I shall take you into custody for stealing this from your employer"—he said "I know I have done wrong; I can't think how I could have been so foolish"—I raised my umbrella to Morgan, who was outside, and he came in—I saw a quantity of silk in the back parlour on the floor, and some on a chair—I heard Laventhall say "That is all the silk I have had from Mr. Hill's; don't lock me up for the sake of my <hi rend="italic">two</hi> children"—she became very excited, kissed our hands, and begged not to be taken in custody—some more silk was found in a hamper under the bed—I found inside Chelmick's coat a large pocket—I afterwards searched his house.</p>

               <p>a female relative of hers was present during the whole of the search and conversation—Laventhall stated that the business was hers, but that her husband was at the Cape of Good Hope—she also said where the silk came from, and in Chelmick's presence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the invoices I took away.</p>

I am a labourer at iron works and live at 3, Orchard Street, Blackheath—on 29th October, about 6.30 a.m., I saw the prisoner walking very fast in Davis Place, where he lives—he was calling out "Good bye, wife and child"—his wife was running after him in her night<lb/>dress, calling him back and asking him what he had done—he said "I have done it; I have cut my child's throat"—he said that he was going to give himself into the hands of the police—Simmonds asked him what he had done—he said "I have cut my child's throat go to my wife's assistance"—I followed the prisoner—he went towards the Blackheath Road, towards the station-house—I met Alter—I told him, and he took the prisoner—he was quiet going to the station.</p>

I am a surgeon and assistant to Mr. Roper, of 5, Lewis<lb/>ham Road, Greenwish—on 29th October, at 6.30,1 went to the prisoner's house and saw Kate Charlotte Gower, a girl 8 years of age, suffering from a long wound going from under her ear to her chin—there was a considerable amount of venous hemorrhage, but no artery was cut—it gradually got deeper and was deepest in the center—I dressed it temporarily, stopped the marriage, and sent her to Guy's Hospital—this razor—would inflict the wound—she is progressing favourably, but is not fit to come out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an agent and sell goods for John Lewis—I live in Kent Street in the Borough—I was in. Covent Garden Market about 6 o'clock on the morning of the 23rd October last—I had a barrow there with six brooms on it—I left it for a few minutes, and when I came back the brooms were gone—about 5 o'clock the same evening I saw the brooms in Kent Street outside a coffee shop—the two prisoners were in the coffee shop—two policemen came up and took them into custody; I put the brooms on the barrow and went with the policemen to the station-house—Archer, by what I could hear, said he bought them off a carrotty<lb/>headed boy for eighteen pence, and that he had given Hickson the money to pay for them—the value of the brushes was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

I shall take you into custody for having them in your possession"—Archer said "I bought them off a carrotty-headed boy in the Covent Garden Market, this morning"—he was remanded; I tried to find the carroty-headed boy, but there was no such boy known—at the time Archer was being charged he said to Hickson "You know Hickson, I gave you money to pay for the brooms"—Hickson retorted "I did not buy the brooms because I had no money, and I know nothing about them."</p>
