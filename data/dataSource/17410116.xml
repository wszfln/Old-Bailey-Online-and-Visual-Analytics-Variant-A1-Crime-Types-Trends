             . On Friday the 2d of January, Wilson the Officer, told me he had a Woman at the Watch-House, and desired me to go with him; I accordingly did, and while we were examining her, the Boy (the Prisoner) who had absconded , was brought to us. We took him into a Room by himself, and ask'd him if he would not relate something to us; he was desired to declare the Truth, and if any Mercy was to be expected, it must be by such Methods. At first, he said, he found the Money in Moorfields; but I told him, that was nothing but an Evasion of his, and if he did not declare the Truth, it would be the worse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174101160003"/> for him: He then fairly own'd that he got over Barnard's Wall into the Garden, open'd the Back-Door, and went up Stairs into the Bed-Chamber; that he open'd the Table-Drawer, and took out a Bunch of Keys in a String; he went into the Closet where the Chest stood, and after he had try'd several Keys, at last found the right; that he took the Purse with the Money, and likewise a little Pill-Box, in which there was other Money, and a Pair of Buttons; that he threw them away, and kept the Money for his own Use. I ask'd him whether any Body was concern'd with him, and that Night he refus'd to tell me; but on examining him again next Morning, he burst in Tears, and said, if he confess'd, we should hang his Mother. I said, if she had been so inhuman as to put the Rope about his Neck, he had better be an Evidence against her: He then said, his Mother help'd him over the Wall, and waited till he came back again, and that they both went Home together. He said, he made his Sister a Present of four of the 36 s. Pieces, and gave his Mother the Remainder, all but one Guinea, with which he bought a Pound of Butter, that he might get it chang'd; that he threw the Butter away, and appropriated the Money to his own Use. The Mother and the Daughter, both abscond for this Affair.</p>

               <p>John Malton. Mr. Barnard told me he had been robb'd of all the Cash he had in the World, and shew'd me the Place from whence it was taken. I ask'd him if he suspected any Body; he told me he had a little Boy lived with him about 3 quarters of a Year ago, and he could suspect no one else. About a Fortnight after this, we got a Warrant and the Mother and Daughter absconded, but the Boy was brought to us at the Magpye, by his Uncle, and he own'd before several People that he got into the House, and took his Master's Money. The next Day he was brought to Mr. Nettle's House, and I desired him to tell the Truth, '' I did (said he) get over the Wall, and go into my '' Master's Chamber ; I have seen where he put his '' Keys, so I open'd the Chest, and took out the Purse, '' and the Box, with a great deal of Money in them, '' and a Pair of Buttons, which I threw away.'' I ask'd him what Money it was? he said it was brave large yellow Money, and there were two Pieces as big again as the rest, and a great many alike. I took a Moidore out of my Pocket, and shew'd him that, but he said the Money was bigger than that. He likewise said, that he gave four Pieces to his Sister, and the rest to his Mother, all but one Guinea, with which he bought a Pound of Butter, in order to get Silver. After the Prisoner was in the Compter, he told his Brother he hid some of the Money under a Shed in the Tenter-Ground, and going to take it from thence, some of it dropp'd into a Crevice, and he could not get it out again: We went to this Place, and dug out these four 36 s.

            , the Prisoner's Brother. I am 13 Years old, and know if I take a false Oath, I shall go to Hell. I went to see my Brother in the Compter, and ask'd him if he had spent all the Money; he said No, for he had hid some of it in the Tenter Ground, and going to take it away, part of it roll'd into a Hole, and he could not get it out again: I went to the Place with Barnard and Malton , and look'd into the Hole, and saw one of the Broad Pieces; I try'd to get my Hand in, but could not, so they got a Pick-Axe, and dug them out.</p>

I took him on Shore, and ask'd him what he had done to bring his Friends into so much Trouble? he said at first, that he gave his Mother the Money, but told her he had found it. When we came to Stroud , he told me he found it in the Tenter-Ground; I desired him to tell the Truth , and he said he did commence (commit) the Robbery, and all the Way as we were coming to Town, he said his Mother did not know but that he found it; but on the Saturday following, he own'd his Mother assisted him in the Robbery. - He is about 13 or 14 Years old.</p>

I had known the Prisoner before, and asked her if she was not surprized to see me; she said she was; I then asked her whether she had spent all the Money? she said she had not, but put her Hand into her Pocket, and gave me a 3 l. 12 s. Piece, which she said was all that was left, except a little Silver. I took her Trunk to my Inn, and on my enquiring after her Mistresses-Ring, she pull'd it off her Finger, and said, she did not know that she had taken it, 'till after she went away: She had these Silver Buckles in her Shoes at the same Time, and before we came out of the Stage-Coach, she gave them to me. When I apprehended her, I ask'd her for the rest of the Things, and she told me they were in her Trunk, and I accordingly found an old Velvet Hood, which the Prosecutor own'd, and likewise four new ones, which the Prisoner said she had bought; she confess'd to me, that she had taken 83 l. 12 s. Pieces, a two Guinea Piece, a 36 s.

Reward for them. In a little Time, I saw the Prisoner in the Stable, and turn'd him out, and about an Hour afterwards, I went to fetch Fearon his Mare, but she was gone.

There were some Boards laid over a wet Place at the Corner of the <placeName id="t17410116-15-crimeloc74">Mansion House</placeName>

While he was doing this the Prisoner Young came before me, and immediately I felt her Hand in my Pocket; upon that I put my Hand into my Pocket and seized her by the Wrist; - her Hand was clench'd in the Bottom of my Pocket; upon my doing this, she with her other Hand struck me a great Blow on the side of the Face, so that I was obliged to quit her Hand which was in my Pocket, else I should not have left my Money. I then took fast hold of her Cloak and never left her 'till I got Assistance to take her from me. The Man immediately quitted me, and ran away; I cry'd out, For God's Sake stop that Man, for he has held me, while the Woman has robbed me: A Coal-Heaver happening to come by, laid hold of him by the Collar, and that other Woman Davis went up to the Man and help'd to get him away, she said she knew him for he was a very good House-keeper and lived the other Side of Moorfields; - she did not molest me but endeavoured to get the Man away from my Friend, and on his escaping she was secured. I am positive the Prisoner Young is the Person whose Hand I took in my Pocket, for it was just under the first Lamp by the Mansion House as you go from hence. When she pull'd her Hand out of my Pocket it was clenched, and I lost out of the 13 s. and Half-penny, two half Crowns and 7 s. - I am sure I had it in my Pocket when the Prisoner came up to me. I can't say how near Davis was to me, but she help'd to pull the Man from the Coal-Heaver, and Young dragg'd me 'till she came up to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see any Money in either of our Hands?</p>
               <p>Gardner. No, but Young had her Hand clenched in my Pocket , and I said, Hussey you have got my Money, upon which she struck me such a Blow, that I was obliged to quit her Hand; I should not have lost my Money if I could have kept her Hand.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Young offer'd me, at the Butcher's Shop in Bearbinder-Lane , a Guinea and a gold Ring, if I would put up with this and let her go; she offer'd to leave it with Mrs. Jefferies the Mistress of the Shop. I had her near an Hour in Custody before I could get an Officer. - The other Woman Davis on the Man's escaping was secured by the Coal Heaver. I found Young's Hand in my Pocket, but she gave me the Blow before she left my Pocket .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you in Fear?</p>
               <p>Gardner. Yes, to be sure I was, I was in Danger of my Life; the Man kept me close up to the Boards, and the Woman came before me immediately.</p>
               <p>Young . How long was it between your losing your Money, and your laying hold of me?</p>
               <p>Gardner . I never left her 'till Mr. Day the Green-Grocer came to my Assistance.</p>
               <p>Young . Where did you lay hold of me?</p>
               <p>Gardner. Just at the Corner of Walbrook; - I had not set my Foot on the Planks , but I was as near to them as could be.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Was you in any Fear when your Money was taken away?</p>
               <p>Gardner. Yes; I was afraid I should get a Mischief by them, I was afraid of my Life. I had her Hand in my Pocket some Time after the Man left me, and the moment I cry'd out, he ran away. It was my right Arm which the Man held, and my Pocket I commonly wear under my Gown on the right Side, so I clapp'd my left Hand which was at Liberty, under my Apron, into my Pocket in this Manner [Here the Witness shewed the Manner in which she seiz'd Young's Hand in her Pocket] and seized her Hand clench'd in the Bottom of my Pocket. The Man when he took hold of me, said, I will help you over Child, for if you should slip into the Water, you will be worse off: immediately Young's Hand was in my Pocket, and I said, this Woman has got all that I have in the World. I quitted her Hand in my Pocket to get hold of her Cloak, and to prevent her doing me further mischief.</p>

             . Last Saturday Night, I was going to see my Sister and her Child Home, and just as we came to the Mansion House, the poor Woman cry'd out, Lord, I am ruin'd! I am ruin'd! I left my Sister, and laid hold of the Man, and this Woman said, this Man has ruin'd me: I held him about a Minute and a half, and these two Women (the Prisoners) came to me, and got hold of me: - Those are the Women at the Bar, I will take my Affidavit of it, they were both upon me at once, and if it had not been for them, I should have held him. I saw them both near the Prosecutrix, before she cried out.</p>
               <p>Davis. How far was it from the Place where the Man got away, to the Place that he laid hold of me?</p>
               <p>How. While the Man and I were struggling, and they were upon me, away run the Man; I pursued him, and they ran after me, and then I laid hold of that Woman in the white Cloak (Davis) but she had a red Cloak on then; - I would not tell a Lie if I knew it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Day. I was sitting in my back Room, and a great many People were running by to Bearbinder-Lane, and just against the Butcher's Shop, this Man had hold of the Woman with the white Cloak (Davis.) The Prosecutrix said that Woman (Young) had pick'd her Pocket of 12 Shillings, she had not a Hat on then, but one under her Cloak I was resolv'd to see the Upshot of this, so I held her, and desired Mr. Jefferies to get an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174101160008"/> Officer, but he could not; however, at last I got one who took the Prisoners into Custody.</p>

I laid hold of Davis's Cloak, and she desired me not to use her ill. The Woman that cry'd out, was by the two Prisoners, but I really can't say whether she had hold of Young's Cloak.</p>

            . I keep a Hatter's-Shop, in Lothbury , under the Church. Last Saturday Night about 7 o'Clock, I had been at a Wine-Vault in Bearbinder-Lane , for a Hat to dress, and coming down the Lane back again, I heard a great Noise, the People cry'd, Stop him! Stop him! just by the Mansion-House . Coming nearer to the Place, I saw two Women, one nearer, the other farther off, one seem'd to be in the Croud, and they said, this is one of the Women. They were both taken up, and somebody cry'd, he has pick'd my Pocket; I was surpriz'd, for these Women to my thinking, were going soberly along. The first Woman (I can't say which it was) had a white Cloak under her Scarlet one; I believe it was that Woman that stands there (Davis.) They were going before a Justice, and I went down Bishop's-gate-street with them to a Square there, - I thought it a strange Thing that the Woman should cry stop him; so I ran down T hrogmorton-street with them, but my Cough coming, I could not keep even with them, but I founded them all the Way, 'till they came hither; and while I stood here in the Yard, I heard a Man say, I am sure I could never say who pick'd her Pocket, but I catched hold of the Man's Collar, and he got away. I was close by the Mansion-House when I heard the Words Stop him! - I was coming down Bearbinder-Lane , and turning the Corner, there was a great Mob; - I had been to Salter's-Hall.</p>
               <p>Jury. We desire he may be ask'd, who these Wine-Vaults belong to?</p>
               <p>Howard . I was order'd to go there, - it is a Wine-Vault just through Salter's-Hall. I can't tell the Name. I went to one of the Servants, who had left Word at my Shop for me to come to him.</p>
               <p>Jury. What is his Name?</p>
               <p>Howard. I can't tell, - if I go to a Wine Vault, I ask for the Servant that ordered me to carry the Hat.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it a Wholesale or Retale Cellar?</p>
               <p>Howard. I don't know; there are a great many Hundred Pipes in the Cellar.</p>
               <p>C. Is it customary to dress Hats for People whose Names you do not know?</p>
               <p>Howard. Yes; I carry them Home, and sometimes I am paid, and sometimes not; if I carry a Hat to a Tavern, I say it is for one of the Drawers, and they enquire about the House for the Owner. I did not hear Women mention'd, but the Woman cry'd Stop him, he has robb'd me; and when I saw the Croud altogether, that Davis was a matter of 20 Yards from the Croud.</p>
               <p>C. Were they not held by any Body?</p>
               <p>Howard . I believe it was that Gentlewoman (Young) in the Croud, but I can't say any Body held her. I have seen Davis before: - I know her no farther than her passing by my Shop two or three Times, but if I was to meet her in the Street again, I don't know her, - I could not swear to her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never saw this Man all the Time.</p>

There was a Man, and likewise 2 Women coming along, and another Woman after them, and there was no Body laid hold of, that I saw, for I did not stop, but went directly Home.</p>

             . I have known Mrs. Young about 3 Quarters of a Year; Mrs Walker desired me to help her to some Plain-work, and a very good Workwoman she is; she has worked for a great many good House-keepers that I know, and they liked her extraordinary well. I met her in Whitechapel. and desired her to go with me to the Rose, at Holborn-Bridge, so, just as we came by the China-Shop , the Corner of the Market, there was a Croud , - it was about 6 o'Clock, and Mrs. Young said, somebody is beating his Wife, and she would go to see what was the Matter. We went up a Passage, and the Woman laid hold of her, and said, you are one of the Women that help'd to rob me: presently another Woman was taken, and I was afraid they would lay hold of me.</p>

            . As I was going down the Hay-market, the 23d of October, between 7 and 8 o'Clock, the Prisoner Fox came up to me; I said Mistress it is a very cold Night, and she said a Dram wou'd do very well, and if I would go with her we might have a Dram of very good Rum just by; I told her I did not care, if I could get a Dram of that which was good, but I belived it would come to neither of our Shares. I went with her to this House , and Mabon followed us in, and when we had drank 3 Quarterns, I would have come out, and was got to the Door for that Purpose , but Fox and Mabon siezed me, and broke a little Stick which I had in my Hand ; they struck and punched me, and made my Cheeks bleed; - the Blood is now to be seen on my Coat: I asked the Man who went for Landlord, what was the Meaning of all this; for they had almost got the Money out of my Pocket, and I said I would send them to the Round-house; upon that the Landlord curs'd them and seemed to take my Part, and desired me to come in and set by the Fire. I went in and staid some Time and there was nobody there but the Landlord, and one that went for Mistress, and the Prisoner Elvar . While I was talking with the Landlord, Richardson the Accomplice came in and call'd for Punch, and they went into another Room and would give me some Liquor; the Landlord set his Back against the Wall and poured out a Glass of red Stuff; I said I had no Money, and would not drink it, and thought somebody would come in, that I might get away; but he swore I should drink it; I ask'd him what it was. O! (says he,) it is Bitters and very wholsome. We sat talking some Time, seemingly very good natur'd, and I said, is it not Time that the Watchman should come about? for I thought to get to the Door when the Watch came by; but he said, No, No, it is not so late as you think. I began to be very uneasy, and in a little Time after they gave me another Glass, and were vastly desirous that I should drink it, but I said I had rather have a Glass of plain Gin; however I drank a little, and they insisted that I should drink it up, but I swore I would not; and as I was getting up to go away, the 3 Prisoners, Richardson and a Man that I never saw before, all rushed into the Room upon me; Richardson held my two Arms and clapp'd his Knee on my Back; - It was done in a Moment; Elvar came before me and clapp'd his right Hand on my Throat, and his Left to my Mouth - his Hand was very cold; at the same Time the two Women came up to me, one on my right Side, and the other on my Left; they put aside my Cloaths and took out of my right Hand Pocket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174101160010"/> my Bag in which were 5 36 s. Pieces, and an 18 s. Piece. Some how or other in the Struggle I threw one of the Men against a Settle, and made a great Racket; so when they had rifled me they all ran out of Doors; I rolled myself round, and took up my Hat, and pursued them, crying, Stop Thief and Murder! I kept them in View, and got Ground of them every Minute. At the End of the Street Mabon separated from the rest, and I desired the Watchman to take hold of them; he did take Fox but let the other go, so I took Mabon myself to the Watch-House. In a little Time afterwards, the Watchmen found Elvar in the House, and brought him to the Watch-House to the others.</p>
               <p>Mabon . Ask him whether the Men or the Women pick'd his Pocket?</p>
               <p>Layton. Elvar was the first that laid hold of me, and I am sure the Women rifled me; I had five of them on me at a Time.</p>
               <p>Elvar . Was it the Man who passed for Landlord that put his Hand to your Throat, or me?</p>
               <p>Layton. Elvar put his Hand on me and very cold it was.</p>
               <p>Elvar . Who put his Knee on your Back?</p>
               <p>Layton . I take it to be Richardson .</p>

               <p>Richardson . When I went in, Elvar told me they were in the Back Room; I went in to them, and they told me that while the old Man ( Layton ) was busie with the Women, one of them had pick'd his Pocket, and he catch'd them at it, and took the Money from them directly. They told me they had given him a Potion of Liquid Laudanum to make him quiet; the Women told me this first in the Back-Room, and when I went into the Fore-Room, Elvar told me the same, and that they were so much in a Hurry that the first Draught had no Effect, but that Cup which I met him with at the Door was a second Potion for him. I saw the old Man was in a Hurry to go away, and then John Mabon and Elvar told the Women in the Back-Room he would go, and said they (the Women) must pick a Quarrel with him, and they would come out to assist them: Accordingly the two Men ran out of the Back-Room first, the two Women followed and siezed the Countryman as he sat in his Chair. The Prisoner Elvar laid hold of him by the Throat, and stopp'd his Mouth with his Coat Sleeve, because he should not make a Noise in the House, and

             bent him backwards; then Priscilla Mabon open'd his Buckskin Breeches and took Money in a Canvass Bag, out of his right Hand Pocket. When this was done, they made the best of their Way into the Court, and on Mr. Layton's crying out, Murder! Stop Thief! the two Women were taken by the Watch, and carried to the Round house.</p>
               <p>Mabon . Ask him on his Oath, whether he was not the Man that put his Knee against Layton's Back?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I was not in the Room then, but on the Threshold of the Door with the Door in my Hand.</p>
               <p>Mabon . What Time of Night was it?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I believe it was a little after Eleven when the Thing was done; - they made a Noise and sung the Countryman some Songs, that he might not hear the Watch pass by.</p>
               <p>Elvar. Did I ever give him any Liquor?</p>
               <p>Richardson. Elvar fill'd the second Glass, and it turn'd the Liquor brown.</p>
               <p>Elvar. I desire the Prosecutor may be asked whether I was out of the Room?</p>
               <p>Layton. Yes, I believe he was out once, if not twice.</p>
               <p>Elvar . Did not we drink of the same Liquor as you?</p>
               <p>Layton . No, they did not drink of the red Liquor; the Landlord touch'd it with his Lips, and fill'd the Glass up to me again. It swell'd me up very much, but it pleased God I cast it up in the Watch-House.</p>

I was Watchman at that Time in St. Martin's Parish, and just after I had called the Hour of Eleven, this Layton cryed, Stop Thief! in the Hay Market , and was running after the two Women; I stopp'd Fox, but the other ran down the Street and Layton after her; I deliver'd Fox to my Partner who came to my Assistance, and then went after Mabon and brought her to the Watch-House. The Prosecutor said there were 3 Men concerned, one of them he described to be a short well set Man, another a little Man in a light Wig and a light Coat, and the other a tall Man in a brown Coat. By this Description we went to the House and took Elvar ; we knocked at the Back Door and it was open'd, and we found him in the House; - the House has no Landlord in it long, for the People are here to Day, and gone To-Morrow.</p>
               <p>Salathiel Gardiner . I am a Watchman: On the 23d of October, about half an Hour after 11 at Night, I heard the Countryman cry, Stop Thief! and at the End of Oxendon-Street, he took hold of the little Woman; she was running away at the same Time, and Mabon was with her.</p>

               <p>Mabon . I drank a Share of three Quarterns of Brandy with the Prosecutor; and then he left our Company, and went into the Fore Room, where he quarrell'd with the Landlord; I can't tell what was the Reason of the Quarrel, but he cry'd, Murder! and the Woman of the House said to us, Girls, run away, for the Watch will take you. No Watchman took me, but Mr. Layton himself.</p>
               <p>Fox. The Men were quarrelling, and the Woman of the House bid us run away, for the Watch would charge us. Ask the Prosecutor, how he could see the Person that robb'd him, being held in that Manner?</p>
               <p>Layton. I could, and did see them; Richardson pinion'd me back, and the little Woman, (Fox) came to my Right Hand Pocket, and took my Money.</p>
               <p>Mahon . Two People could not pick his Pocket at once.</p>
               <p>Layton. I believe the Little One took my Money; but they were both at my Pocket together.</p>
               <p>Elvar. I was in the House, and saw them quarrelling; but as to Money, I never saw any, nor ever was near the Prosecutor to lay Hands on him, during the Time he was in the House. When the Quarrel began, I was at one Door, and the People ran out at the other, and Layton pursu'd them.</p>

I thought it was impossible I should be robb'd in the Street, and I went out of the House designing to go to my Inn; but when I got to the Corner of the Court, I was obliged to go close by Keogh's House; immediately two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174101160012"/> Men and two Women laid violent Hands on me, and pull'd me into the House, and shut the Door.

             , and the two Prisoners, Dennison and Stacey ; they pulled me down on my Back, and the Woman that was executed, by the Assistance of Stacey and another, tore open my Breeches Pocket, and took out my Gold, to the Value of 23 Guineas, in Guineas and Portugal Pieces, and likewise my Watch. After this they brought in Cherry-Brandy in Pint Mugs, and swore if I did not drink, they would stab me or cut my Throat. I was forced to drink till they thought I had lost my Senses, and then they carried me out of that Room into another, and laid me on a Bed. When they found I began to slumber, they jostled me, and made me drink again. I had a Pair of Spurs which appeared like Silver, and Stacey took one of them off, but put it on again. I made a great Noise for my Money and my Watch; upon which Stacey, some how or other, slipped my Watch into my Great Coat Pocket, and bid me search myself, for I had lost nothing; accordingly I put my Hand in my Pocket, and felt some Money, which I hop'd was my Gold, but I dar'd not pull it out, for fear they should get that from me.</p>
               <p>* See Sessions-Book, 1740, No. 8. p. 271.</p>
               <p>Councel. In what Pocket was your Watch, when you went into the House?</p>
               <p>Parish . I am positive it was in my Fob, and he put it into my great Coat Pocket. - There were a great many People in the House, that did not come into the Room where I was.</p>
               <p>Councel. What did they do to you after this?</p>
               <p>Parish . They forced me out of Doors, pretending to carry me to my Inn, and led me into Long-Acre , where Stacey kick'd up my Heels, and Dennison held me, while he rifled me; I could see several People by me at the same Time. He took a pair of Breeches, and a pair of silver Knee-buckles, which were ty'd up in a Bundle, a Holland Shirt, my Watch , with the rest of my Money, and my Hat; I lost my Wig, but I can't charge them with that. After this they left me, and I roll'd into Drury-Lane, where I fell asleep. I am positive the Prisoners are the Men, for I saw them very plain when they forced me out of Doors, and they led me into the Street, one on one Side, the other on the other, and never quitted me till they had robb'd me.</p>
               <p>Dennison . Did you see me in the House before you had drank the Brandy?</p>
               <p>Parish . Yes, he sat facing the Door when I came in, and I saw him afterwards, for the Watch convey'd me to the Cart and Horse in Broad St. Giles's, and he and Stacey came to me there. Dennison talked Irish with the Landlord, and told me, it I sat there a Fortnight it should cost me nothing.</p>
               <p>Councel . How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Parish . I staid till Day-light, and the Ostler of my Inn came and took me away. The Prisoners brought a Violin, and we were very merry, for I was in Liquor, and had no Thoughts of my Misfortune. Sometime afterwards, I not knowing how to proceed, a Fellow, one Baker, offer'd me his Assistance as an Attorney, and got a Bill of Indictment drawn according to his own Way of Thinking; I paid him 2 s. for it, and he has dropp'd me, and keeps the Indictment. If I was to see him here I should know him. I have met with just such another Affair, one Lloyd offer'd himself as an Attorney, he would have made Dennison an Evidence, and would not let me see the Justice upon any Account .</p>
               <p>Councel. When had you the first Information of the Parties concern'd in this Street Robbery?</p>
               <p>Parish . I had an Information from the Justice, that one of them had made himself an Evidence; I was in the Country, and was very sorry when I received the Letter, to be taken from my Business.</p>

I lost the Value of three and twenty Guineas in Gold, out of my Breeches Pocket, and I cry'd, Murder! Robbery! at the same Time.

               <p>Councel. Was you there when Mr. Parish was robbed?</p>
               <p>Macdonnel . I was a-bed, and heard a Cry of Murder, so I put on my Coat, and came down Stairs, and saw Mr. Stacey, Dennison, Lineham, and Massey, the Woman I keep Company, all on the Gentleman at once; Stacey kept him down with his Knee , and did what he could to prevent his crying out.</p>

               <p>Lineham . How often did I come to him?</p>
               <p>Macdonnel. She came to me twice a Day, till she was taken up for another Robbery, and put into Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Lineham I think it is a very hard Case if he knew me to be guilty, that he did not detain me when I went to him in Prison.</p>

I am positive I made my Chambers and my Desk secure about 8 o'Clock; the Window was fasten'd with a Shutter, and a Pin put through it; but the next Morning between 7 and 8, I found the Shutter cut open. The Prisoner was my Barber's Servant, and I never suspected him 'till his Master came to me, and gave me sufficient Reason to believe that he was the Person who had Robb'd me; then I took him up, and had him examin'd by Mr. Justice De Veil, and he there confessed that he was the Person that robb'd me. The next Day we carry'd his Box to the Justices, and searched it; we found in it nine Moidores, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174101160016"/> double Moidore and half; we likewise found a Guinea and half in the Prisoner's Pocket, which he confessed was part of my Money.</p>

             . On the 17th of December, about 11 at Night, I lost my Gelding out of the Stable , and the next Morning I found him in Paddington Pound. I likewise lost the same Night 18 Geese and 9 Ducks; and as I was on the Road coming to Town, I met a Man, who told me he had seen a Man selling such Fowls as mine in Carnaby Market ; accordingly I went to one Bowton's , a Butcher in the Market, and he shewed me a Duck which he had bought, and I knew it to be mine. The Prisoner Willis was described to me to be one of the Persons concerned, and I took him a-bed at his Lodging; I charged him with robbing me, and he owned that he and Briggs took the Ducks and Geese, and finding them pretty heavy, they took the Gelding out of the Stable, and loaded him with them; but when they came to Tyburn . they turned him loose. I found 12 of my Geese at Willis's House, but all my Ducks were disposed of. He gave me this Halter, and said, it was the Halter which was on the Gelding, when they took him out of the Stable.</p>

With some Difficulty I got her before Mr. Justice Fowke , and there she confested that she took the Linnen, and sold it to Barfoot for 11 s. that Barfoot knew they were stolen, and bought them as such.

Mr. Browning sent for me, and told me, there was a Woman in Custody for buying his Linnen for 11 s. and desired me to go and s ee her. Accordingly I went into Ratcliff Highway, and found Barfoot in Custody; I told her if she would let me have the Goods, I would give her the 11 s. again; at first she would not, but afterwards she said, if you will not whiddle of me, perhaps I may help you to the Goods; then she order'd a Man ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174101160019"/> one Hope, to go with me into Shorter-street , by Rag-Fair; we went a little Way in the Street, and he knock'd at a Door, and when we came in, I saw the two Prisoners Harrison and Smith in the House, there were abundance of Candlesticks and such Things, and a half Firkin of Butter lying about, so that I wished myself out of Doors The Prisoner Smith said, Is this the Gentleman? and Harrison said, can we trust him ? and the Man bid me give Harrison the Money; I gave her half a Guinea and 6d. and then Smith gave me the Goods, and I came away. After this I I went to the Constable , and told him the Story, and he threat'ned to prosecute me for compounding Felony. When we were before the Justice, Barfoot and Hope wanted to make it up with me, and she is now out upon Bail . The House from whence I had these Goods, went by the Name of Barfoot's, and I have enquired since this, and find it was hers, but she has left it. She is a very bad Woman, and a reputed Receiver of stolen Goods.</p>

Accordingly he staid, and sung the Company several Songs, but half an Hour after 11 he went privately away, and the next Morning I missed the Tankard. I heard a very bad Character of the Prisoner, so I took him up on Suspicion, and advertised the Tankard, and it was stopped by Mr. Kay, and brought to me; I am sure it is the same Tankard that he drank out of, for I have not another like it.</p>

             . The woman Prisoner brought this Tankard to me on the 11th of Dec. and desired me to buy it, she told me it was the Property of one Norcatt her Husbands Master, I had some Suspicion of its being stolen, and I bid her fetch her Husband. Accordingly he came, and told me the same Story as she had done, and said that his Master was a Plummer and Painter; but he was under Misfortunes, and apprehensive of being arrested; that he was obliged to raise 7 l. and if I would lend him 2 or 3 Guineas on this Tankard, it would make up the Money. I told him it was very proper that I should see his Master ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174101160020"/> and know whether he was the Owner of it or not; then he said his Master was at his Lodging in Summer-street , Cold Bath Fields; I accordingly went there, but no Master was to be found. The next Morning the Woman Prisoner came to me, and said, I might be very easy for there was no Advertisement; she pull'd a News-Paper out of her Pocket; and on looking over it, I found this very Tankard advertised. I then acquainted Mr. Gibson, and he told me he had got a Man in Custody, on Suspicion of stealing it; and in a few Hours I saw the Prisoner before the Justice, and knew him to be the Man that came to my Shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . Ask him whether it was brought in my Name?</p>

             . On the 10th of December, I was going to the other End of the Town, and called in Summer street , where the Prisoner lived. The Prisoner's Wife asked me to stay to Breakfast, and while I was there, a pretty tall Man in blue grey Cloaths came up stairs; - this was about 11 o'Clock in the Morning; he had a Tankard without a Lid under his Coat, it was tied up in a speckled Handkerchief; he said he wanted about 40 s. on it, for he was in inlection of being arrested and he delivered it to her, and she went out with it: While she was gone, the Prisoner

             came in and asked for his Wife, and the Man told him where he had sent her; in the mean Time she came up and said, the Pawnbroker suspected the Tankard was stolen; upon that, the Prisoner flew in a great Passion with his Wife, for going with it, and gave her a great Blow on the Head. The Man then desired the Prisoner to go and fetch either the Money or Tankard, and accordingly he went, and the very next News that I heard of them was, that they were in Consinement . I believe this was either Wednesday or Thursday, and I am sure it was the 10th of December .</p>
               <p>Mr. Kay. This very Woman came to me 3 or 4 Days after Lacock's Commitment, and said he was her Husband, and if she could be of any Service to him in saying any Thing in his Behalf she would; that she had received a Letter from him, and 'till then she knew nothing of the Affair.</p>
               <p>Harding . He is not my Husband; I had a lawful Husband, and he died on board the Scarborough Man of War.</p>
               <p>Gibson . It was the 10th of December that I lost my Tankard, and I did not miss it till between 11 and 12 at Night.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the Tankard only in the private Room, when Wilson and the Prisoner were alone; or was it carried into the Club Room ?</p>
               <p>Gibson . The Tankard was used when the Company were there, but it was at the Prisoner's Table ; - there were three or four Persons at each Table.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see any Man in the Room, in a blue grey Coat?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No, the Prisoner was the only Stranger in the Company; all the rest were Neighbours and creditable House keepers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know no more of this, than the Child that is unborn; I had paid my Reckoning, at 6 o'Clock and was coming away, but he entreated me to stay and sing the Company a Song.

             . On the 19th of December my Wife having Occasion to go out, pull'd off her Watch; and hung it on the Sconce , and the next Day going to look for it it was gone. I advertis'd it the Monday following, and had Information of the Chain from a Pawnbroker, to whom it was offer'd by the Prisoner's Mother. I had the Prisoner taken up on Suspicion of stealing it, and he in Excuse said he found it.</p>

I saw there had been something torn from it, and ask'd her how she came by it? I likewise told her I should detain it 'till I had seen the Person of whom she had it In a little while the Prisoner and another Man came and he said he had found it, but I was resolved to keep it till I knew farther; I examined the News-Paper and found such a Chain advertised, and the Prisoner coming to me again at Night, he was secured, and he said he found it in the Street by Queen-Hithe .</p>
               <p>Mr. Jenkins , I saw the Watch hanging on the Sconce, the 19th of Dec. just before it was lost.</p>

On the Friday before Christmas-Day, between 9 and 10 at Night, I went into the Yard, and the Prisoner shoved against me, I asked him what he did there? and he ran out directly; I went to look for the Pipe and it was gone; I inform'd Mr. Fortescue of this, and he pursued the Prisoner, I followed, and saw the Prisoner taken, but did not see the Pipe drop; this is the Pipe, and I saw it in the Yard about an Hour before it was taken. It is a private Yard, and enclosed.</p>

               <p>Job Rowe . On the 19th of Dec. the Prisoner came to my House, and staid about a quarter of an Hour, and while my Back was turned, he took an Opportunity to take this Money out of a Drawer in the Room where he was. Soon after he was gone, I missed my Money, and I am positive no Body but he was there that could take it, I followed him to the Ship in Broad-street, and there took him, and charged him with robbing me. I saw the String of my Bag hang out of his Pocket, and then he own'd that he had chang'd some of my Money for Gold.</p>

I asked him how he came by it, and he said he was employ'd by a Gentleman at the George in Leather-Lane to sell it for him; I stopped it, and went to the George to enquire, and found that what the Prisoner said was entirely false. While I was there the Ostler of the Black-Lion came in, and said he had been robb'd, and I inform'd him that such Goods were offered to me for Sale.
