                  </hi>. I live at Leamington, but temporarily in London, and am a land agent—towards the end of August last year I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I replied to that advertisement, and in reply received a letter signed Frederick William Fryer—in consequence of that I called on the prisoner on 29th August, at his office, in Lowden House, Surrey Street, Strand—he said that he wanted a secretary for a company which had been started some time, and had taken over a paper called <hi rend="italic">The British Building Journal</hi>, illustrated—he showed me a paper similar to this—before he showed it me he said the paper was a thorough sound-going concern, and had been running for a considerable period—I perused the paper and said, "You have some good advertisements here, some from leading houses in London"—having had considerable experience in advertisements, and knowing it to be a custom among newspapers to insert <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi> advertisements, that is, copies from other papers, I said, "Are all these advertisements genuine? and I pointed to three in particular; one was the Sun Fire Office, one the Birkbeck Bank, and the other the Comptroller of the City—he said that every one of the advertisements was genuine—I then asked him what the circulation of the paper was—he said it was 2,000 weekly—I asked him whether the paper was published regularly every week—he said it had only once missed being published each week from its commencement—as it was about lunch-time, he suggested I had better go and get some lunch and come back in the afternoon, which I did; and he then said he would be pleased to appoint me as secretary on condition that I advanced £100, which would be returned at one month's notice—I replied that I was pleased with the representations he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189203070004"/>
               <p>made to me regarding the paper, but that as I knew nothing about him I must have some further evidence as to his status—he said, "Oh, I can give you this, Mr. Cawthorn, easily;" and then went on to say, "I have a large estate at Greenhithe, in Kent, for which I paid £20,000, and I am at the present time in receipt of an income, from houses already built on the estate, of over £700 a year," showing me at the same time a plan, with the estate cut up into plots—he then went on to say, "I am one of the surveyors of the London School Board," and also showed me a letter, which he read to me. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. J. M. Kent, managing clerk to the solicitors for the prosecution, proved the service of a notice to produce this letter, by leaving it with the porter at the prisoner's office. The prisoner handed in the letter, which purported to come from the London School Board, dated March</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1891, <hi rend="italic">returning his account to be amended by charging an additional fee</hi>)—I think the prisoner said he had charged eight or nine guineas—while looking at the letter he explained the circumstances of the transaction—I said it was only a valuation which any auctioneer or land agent could do, and not any survey at all—he replied, "I know that; I was only showing that as an instance to show how foolish the School Board are; but I have done scores of surveys for them at other times"—after that he said, "I think I have shown you I am a man of position, and the only reason I ask you to advance the £100 is because your position here will be a responsible one; you will sometimes have large sums of money passing through your hands, and as it is usual with all other firms in London, where men hold responsible positions, are asked for adequate security of some kind, I thought I should like to have one also"—he then said, "I want to be absent from town all next week, and I should like to have this matter settled before I go, and should like to have this cheque"—I said, "Relying on the representations you have made to me, I am willing to deposit my cheque for £100, on the understanding that you secure me by giving me one hundred fully paid-up six per cent, preference shares, redeemable at one month's notice"—he replied, "I am a man of honour, and I hope you are, and you may rely on the representations I have made to you"—he then dictated to me an agreement appointing me his secretary at £100 per annum—this is the agreement—the body of it is in my writing, and he signed it—this is the other agreement. (<hi rend="italic">These agreements were both dated 29th August</hi>, 1891; <hi rend="italic">the first agreed to appoint the prosecutor private secretary to the defendant, at a salary of</hi> £ 100 <hi rend="italic">per annum, and to have Kim proposed as secretary to the</hi> British Building Journal; <hi rend="italic">the second stated that in consideration of his having handed him</hi> £100, <hi rend="italic">he agreed to transfer to him two hundred fully paid-up shares in the said building society, and to take back the said shares and repay the</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">in the event of the company going into liquidation</hi>)—when the prisoner suggested that he wanted to go away the following week, I suggested that I should be absent at the same time to go to North Devon—I wrote these agreements at the prisoner's dictation—he then wanted me to give him my cheque; but as I was not quite satisfied to have to wait till the following Friday week for the shares, I required before parting with my cheque an additional security—upon that he said, "I will give you a cheque on my bankers for £100, but you must not pay it in for a week after you have commenced your duties"—he said I should have my shares on the following Friday week, at the same time he said, "I always keep a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189203070005"/>
               <p>good substantial balance at my bankers, and there is plenty there to meet this cheque"—this is the cheque he gave me. (<hi rend="italic">This was a cheque for</hi> £100 <hi rend="italic">on the Western Bank of London, Charing Cross, payable to Frederick William Fryer, endorsed by the prisoner, and was marked, "account closed</hi> 13-9-91")—I thereupon gave him my cheque for £ 100; this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This was on the Metropolitan and Birmingham Bank, Limited</hi>)—I have since inquired of the persons about the advertisements I saw in the paper. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner admitted that the advertisements were in his handwriting</hi>)—I commenced my duties on Monday, February 7th—I had not been in the office more than an hour before the prisoner came, in great haste, saying he had left his cheque-book behind, and as he had to make a very important payment that morning, would I mind loaning him £40 till to-morrow, in the meantime he would give me, as security, a bill for £44, drawn by a Mr. W. Peek, who, he stated, was a well-known solicitor in London, and a member of the firm of Mason and Co., of 37, Sackville Street—I said I did not know him, and would be glad if he would lend me a Law list—he said he had not one, but I might take his word of honour that it was truth—this conversation took place in his private office, in Surrey Street, Strand—I said, "Upon these representations I will advance you the money until tomorrow"—at lunch-time that day I went and made inquiries whether this Mr. Peek was a solictor, and I found he was nothing more or less than a solicitor's clerk—this is the bill the prisoner gave me. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated August</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1891, <hi rend="italic">payable at the Western Bank of London, Charing Cross</hi>)—upon having this bill I gave him my cheque for £40—this is it, dated 8th September, 1891—I did not receive the money on the following day—I received a £10 note about eight days afterwards from the prisoner—upon finding that Peek was not a solicitor, I saw that I had been defrauded, and the next day I made inquiry as to the prisoner's other representations he had made to me, and I found that the paper was not published for three or four weeks at a time, and that the advertisements were not genuine—I have never been able to discover any solicitor named Peek—after I found out, from the fellows in the office, that the representations he had made were false, I went and taxed him pointedly, and said, "What have you to say?"—he said, "I admit I ought not to have made those misrepresentations, but if you stick to me things will be all right later on"—I said, "How can I stick to you? I find you have not even paid any rent the whole time you have been in these large offices, and that three distress warrants have been taken out against you by the landlord, Mr. Home"—I also told him that I found he had left his last office steeped in debt, and notwithstanding that he took these large offices, double the size and more than double the rent; then again I said, "What about the creditors who have been coming in all this week threatening pro feedings?"—creditors had been coming in all day long during the whole time I was there, money-lenders and others—he said, "Dont you fear about them, I have been in this predicament before; let them take proceedings; I can talk any judge or jury over, and then I can plead my age"—I said, "How can I stick to you, a swindler?"—that was all the conversation that took place at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the prisoner.</hi> The last conversation I have mentioned took place in your private office—I did not mention that at Bow Street, because I was told to state the simple facts of the case—I solemnly swear</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189203070006"/>
               <p>you made that statement—I had never seen you before Saturday, 29th August—you asked me to call in the afternoon of that day to talk the matter over, and it was then I agreed to give you the £100 on the security of the shares—I think I only saw one of the paper then, and took it away—I saw at the bottom of the inside cover that information in respect of the advertisements could be obtained of W. J. King, 15, Walbrook, but I never saw that till the last time; it is not in this one—I asked you if the advertisements were inserted every Friday—I never knew who was the owner of the Greenhithe Estate—I did not see a copy of the contract till I had been three days in the office—nothing was said about the School Board till the afternoon—it was after you had made that statement that I paid you the £100—you did not show me the agreement with the company till after I was in the office—I did not take away a copy of the paper at the first interview, not till I went to North Devon, and you told me to read it while I was away on my holiday—you showed me a number of cheques—when you gave me your cheque you asked me to keep it back till the week after I commenced my duties, and in the meantime I should probably have the shares, and then I need not pay it in—I have not received fully paid-up shares, only the shares that were cancelled; I made out all the shares in the office, yours included—you asked me to make them cut, to fill up my time, saying there was to be a meeting on the Monday; they were made out previous to allotment—I attended two meetings of the directors—I was secretary to the company, but the facts were concealed from me—you told me that the agreements were confirmed, and that they were registered—you afterwards told me that there was no agreement; that was after I found it all out—you wanted the allotment to allow you to borrow money on them; directly you got them you went to several money dealers in the City to borrow money on them, as you were hard up—I was not aware that there was a liability of £2,000 on the shares—you and I were elected as secretaries, but at the second meeting I resigned—the shares I wrote out were cancelled by the directors at the board meeting; I made them out on your instructions—I paid in your cheque on 18th September; I commenced my duties on the 7th—you wrote me one letter while I was away on my holiday—I should not like to swear whether you stated that the company was registered or about to be registered; you told me that the company was already formed, and there had been several Board meetings—you did not show me a prospectus without the names of the directors on it; I never saw the prospectus—you did not tell me that if I came to the company now you could let me have two hundred shares for my £100 out of your own, but that you could not do it after the company was registered; the understanding was that you would secure me by giving me one hundred fully paid-up shares and one hundred ordinary shares—I paid in your cheque on the day stipulated, which was a week after I commenced my duties—I remember meeting you at Mr. Jenkins's office—I then mentioned that a receiving order had been made against you—I did not mention that I had paid in your cheque, because Mr. Jenkins was acting on your behalf—I did not go to him to act for me; I went to him to ask if you owed him money; he told me you owed him £80 or £90, and he was doing his best to obtain it from you—I suggested to him that you had defrauded me—I do not remember saying that the company could not go on—you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189203070007"/>
               <p>did not tell me to stick to the company and not be foolish if I did not want to lose my money—I did not promise to do so—you may have said that if I stuck to the company you would see that I got my money back, but if I resigned I should no doubt lose it—I gave you the £10 in the office; that was in part payment of the £44 bill that you promised to pay me on the following day—I did not tell you when I first came to you that I liked making small loans to people—I never did a loan in my life till I made it to you—I gave you the £40 because you asked me to lend it you, that you would get into trouble if you did not make an important payment that morning—Messrs. Edell and Gordon were acting for me on that date—I had instructed them to write to you for payment of the £44—it was simply a clerical error on their part in applying for the full amount; I instructed them to apply for the amount, less £10—I deny that you discounted the bill for me; you only gave it me as security till the next day; I did not know you, and would not lend money without some security—I made a demand for the £40 the following day—I never told Mr. Jenkins that if you looked after me I could stop any proceedings about to be taken against you—I said I had heard that a solicitor in the City would prosecute you, and I would do my best to stop it for you; I did not add, "if you paid me the money"—I have not the faintest idea of having said so; I went to see Mr. Jenkins under great excitement, and what I really said I don't know—some proceedings were taken against you—I was subpœnaed as a witness at this Court, but was not called; I do not know why—after the meeting at Mr. Jenkins's, I wrote a letter resigning my position as secretary—I did not go to Brighton with you as a friend—I went there on different business altogether, to persuade you to marry the girl you had ruined—I did not dine with you as a friend—I went to the theatre, not with you—I went to see my lawyer at Brighton; he was out; I can't remember his name at the moment—I was in your office after this many times; I was investigating and making inquiries in order to commence these proceedings—you saw me there—I went in there for about an hour every day, to make inquiries about statements I had heard—I never negotiated for the purchase of some houses on the estate at Greenhithe—I was asked to obtain £1,000 on a mortgage of seven or eight cottages there—I went down and saw your assistant there by appointment—that was after you were made bankrupt, after the receiving order—I was working in your room, but not with your assistant; he might have been there, but not the whole time—I have not subpœnaed him or Mr. Winchmore; I believe my solicitors have subpœnaed him—I gave instructions to my solicitors in this matter at the latter end of September; I could not commence all in a hurry; I had to consider the matter for some time—you may have introduced the solicitor's son to me in your office—I knew that solicitor was acting for you in bankruptcy proceedings, not in anything else—I went to him to ask if you owed him any money, because he knew more about you than any other solicitor—I do not think I was present at a Board meeting when you stated that a receiving order had been made against you—I do not remember the directors stating that they had seen the official receiver, and that there was no objection to completing the purchase—I told them that you had defrauded me; I may have said it to all of them; I believe I said it at an open meeting, but I won't swear</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189203070008"/>
               <p>that—I believe the company was stopped on account of the receiving order, and the paper not being worth anything—I never heard that your landlord volunteered to find £2,000 to carry on the paper—I have subpœnaed Mr. Hill as a witness—I believe I was here at the last hearing of this case—I never stated that if you took action against me I would protect myself and you should not be able to get a penny from me; that it was all in my wife's name—I never remember making such a statement; I won't swear it—I never saw the agreement or contract of the vendor for the purchase of the estate—you did not say that you were going to acquire the estate, and that a firm of solicitors were willing to advance the money—I did not say that I thought it a very good thing, and that we could work it together—I did not go to the agent for the advertisements, because I never knew that you had an agent—I did not see it on the paper that day; I may have seen it, but I did not notice it that day—I have not been round to a great many of your creditors, to induce them to come and give evidence against you; all who have given evidence were subpœnaed by my solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believe the company has gone to smash—it was by the prisoner's instructions that I drew some of the shares before they were allotted—the directors told me to cancel them—I have not received any of those shares, nor has anyone else; I went to Brighton with the prisoner, because he came to me on the Monday after the receiving order and asked me to come down on account of some little trouble he had got into with someone, I think he said he was contemplating marriage, or I may be mistaken about that—I said I was willing to go with him as I had to make a call at Brighton that evening; he said he was staying at the Markham's hotel—he said he had ruined a girl.</p>

Receiver claimed the £500; he said that was all he should look after, he did not care about the 2,000 shares—it was proposed that the directors should run the paper until a meeting of your creditors was held, and they were willing to do so—I was present when Cawthorn handed you a letter resigning his position as secretary, I have the letter here in the minute, book—the resignation was accepted—nothing was said about his giving a month's notice, we did not know about that—I never heard that he had been defrauded out of his money by you; I did not know of the money till some time afterwards; that was not the ground of the resignation—I did not hear till afterwards that he had been defrauded of £10O—I don't know that it would have made any difference if we had known it; we appointed him secretary because he was your nominee, and you had brought the company to us—perhaps the directors would have preferred some one with an interest in the company; I don't think it affected us at all—my firm had arranged for a part of the capital to come into the company—my firm was then Harrison, Rees</p>

Edell and Gordon prosecuted you—I am a considerable loser by the paper; the company was taking it over because they had a very extensive channel of their own for advertisements, and that was the reason of their valuing the paper so highly—we had one firm who could have filled it with advertisements, and we did not care what the past had been; we knew what we could make it in the future—I have known you for some time as an architect and surveyor, and I have never known anything of this nature against you—I am a creditor of yours for about £280 I should think.</p>

I did not go there with a felonious intent; I went to get a coat that I had left there"—at the station he made the same reply to the inspector.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an overseer at the North-Western District Post Office—on 4th March, in consequence of a communication from the postman, I examined the letter-box in the Mornington Road, and found in the aperture, a quantity of yellowish sticky matter—I went to a public-house opposite, and watched—about 1.45 the prisoner went the box, and placed both his hands in the hole, and, after fumbling about, about two minutes, I went across—he saw me, and took his hand out and went across the road—I overtook him, and asked him what he was doing—he said, "Nothing"—I said I should detain him—he said, What for? '—I said, "For tampering with the pillar-box"—I asked him again what he was doing—he said, "Posting a letter"—I asked him the address of the letter—he said, "Birmingham"—I said, "We ill have the box cleared and examined—I showed him the sticky stuff the hole, and there was some on his hands—he was asked the address on the letter again, and said he did not know; a gentleman had given to him to post—I took him to the General Post Office.</p>

               <p>lived together there, they occupied the front parlour, the back parlour, and the back room first floor, and the top rooms at the back—the two parlours are on the ground floor—they slept in the front parlour; I occupied the room immediately over that—they had been there for some time before Christmas; I daresay for four months—on 4th February I went to bed between nine and half-past nine—I did not hear the prisoner and deceased come in—about eleven there were two knocks at my door—after a time I answered—I then heard the prisoner say, "Will you come down? Elizabeth is dead"—I said, "Never," and as he walked away from the door, he said, "I have cut her throat"—I did not hear him go downstairs—I heard people running in the street, and talking; I then got up and went down in a few minutes—I did not see anybody in their room; all the doors were open—there was a crowd outside the Friend-in-Hand public-house, two or three doors below—I did not go into the prisoner's room till the police came; I was at the door when the police took charge of the place; I left them in charge, and went upstairs—as far as I observed, the prisoner and deceased apparently lived very comfortably before he was out of employment—he was a chimney sweep—I think he fell out of work about Christmas time, or a week after; I could not say exactly—he earned a little after that, not much; he earned what he could—they were pressed for money, I think; I heard them want money to pay their rent—there were several quarrels, but not of a serious nature, words, generally about money matters, and jealousy—on one occasion they were not quarrelling, they were talking; the deceased was sitting sewing in the back kitchen, and they were laughing, and the prisoner said, "Oh! you blue-eyed beauty, if you have deceived me I will walk with a firm step to Newgate for the woman I love"—I can't remember how long that was before the 4th February; it might be a fortnight or three weeks, but they were very happy together after that—about Christmas time I lent the prisoner a razor to shave with; it was a. very old one—I saw a razor with a case produced at the Police-court; it was like the one I had lent him.</p>

Elizabeth is dead"—I should have known it was him, because there was no one else in the house—I never heard him mention the name of the man when they quarrelled about jealousy; it was someone she was very familiar with.</p>

               <p>was in bed—I heard as if it was one person coming in, and I heard him go into the back parlour, which I call the kitchen, one of the rooms occupied by the prisoner and deceased—I heard the prisoner say to the person, "You shan't go out of this house to-night"—he repeated that twice—I next heard a scuffle at the foot of the stairs—I then heard the front door open and slam to—I got up and went downstairs—as I went down I passed the prisoner at the door of Mrs. Stewart, one of the lodgers (before that I heard moaning in the street which caused me to open my window to know what it was); he was knocking at her door and saying, "Stewart, Stewart, come down, I have done for her"—I left him there and went straight down into the street to the Friend-in-Hand at the corner—I there saw the deceased lying on the ground bleeding, I could not say where from—I had been living in the house for a month or two before 4th February—I have heard the deceased and prisoner quarrelling together frequently; I once heard it was because she promised to meet another man, and the prisoner would not allow it—I have heard him say she had promised to meet him, and I have heard him say she should not go out to meet him—the man was at the door at the time with her—about four weeks before the 4th February there was a quarrel, and he took up the tongs and threatened to strike her—that was in their front parlour—I went down into the room to protect her, because the children were crying—he picked up the tongs when I was in the room—he said he meant banging her on the head, and I stepped between them and he hit me instead, he hit me on the head with his fist, not with the tongs; after that I went back to my room; the deceased came up with me—I noticed that her earings were torn out of her ear, and her ear was bleeding—on another occasion, soon after Christmas, he was going to kill her; he came indoors in a rage because she did not come home with him, and he went into the back parlour and got a knife out of the table drawer, went into the yard and sharpened it on a stone, and put it into his trousers pocket—the deceased was not in the house at that time, she was down at her mother's—it was the day her mother had died, and she had been there all day—when he put the knife in his pocket I tried to prevent his going out, I asked him not to go out with it, not to go out of the house at all, she would be sure to be in soon—he said if I did not get out of the way he would draw it across my throat—at the time he was getting it out of the drawer he said, "I mean to cut her throat;" he then went out of the house, he went towards Walton Place—the deceased was at her mother's house in Smith Street—I sent the woman's son Bobby out, about fifteen years of age, to keep him out of the way, to let it be known what he had said he was going to do; he brought the prisoner back soon after—I think that was the last I heard, until the very night the deed was done.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">B</hi> 468). On the night of 4th February, hearing a shout of "Police!" I went to the Friend-in-Hand and saw the deceased lying on the floor bleeding from a wound in her throat—I did what I could to stop the bleeding—in about seven minutes Dr. Leggatt came in—the woman died a few minutes afterwards—she did not speak at all.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189203070033"/>
               <p>a wound in the throat—she died within a minute or two after I got there—the constable had done all that could be done to stop the bleeding—I made a post-mortem examination—the wound was five inches long, and down to the vertebrae of the spinal column; it extended from an inch and a-half below the ear on the right side to two inches and three-quarters from the medium line on the left side—there was no evidence of the instrument having actually touched the vertebra—it went down to the vertebra—the direction was from right to left, and from above downwards, and larger on the right side than the left—on the right side the structures down to the spinal column were divided, the carotid artery not being entirely severed, but the principal hemorrhage came from the carotid artery—the hemorrhage from the wound was. the cause of death—this razor would produce the wound—when I first saw it there were marks on it, apparently of blood—very great force must have been used to produce the results I found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From the result of my post-mortem examination I did not come to the conclusion that she was a woman of intemperate habits to any extent—the liver was somewhat enlarged—it is difficult to say what was the cause of that—I did not know her in life—it was not an alcoholic liver; it was not diseased, only enlarged—it was natural except from being enlarged, but pale from hemorrhage—a pint of beer a day for several years would produce such a liver—if she had been intemperate she would have been more subject to inflammation; that is a secondary result, not a primary one—I do not think her life could have been saved if I had seen her earlier—the wound was in a downward direction—that was not indicative of a struggle—I do not mean to suggest that the wound was inflicted without any struggle—in my opinion it was homicidal, not suicidal—I have known very deep wounds inflicted on themselves by suicides—I have not examined the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The direction of the wound being downwards is important, and, what is more important still, it was on the right side of the throat, that, to my mind, indicates that it was homicidal, not suicidal, unless the woman was left-handed.</p>

About ten minutes to eleven on the night of 4th February I went with another constable to 100, North Street; the door was open—I went in and met the prisoner in the passage—I told him I should take him into custody—he said, "All right; I will go with you"—outside the door I said, "I shall charge you with cutting your wife's throat"—he said, "1s. she dead?"—I said, "I think she is"—he then said, "Poor dear, this is all through jealousy; it has been going on for some time"—at the station he was charged with having feloniously caused her death—he said, "Well, I suppose I must put up with it"—I took possession of his hat and coat—the coat was afterwards shown to Dr. Leggatt—the prisoner appeared to be perfectly sober.</p>

               <p>the prisoner came to me and asked to see some underclothing. I showed him some. He selected three rests, three pants, and six pairs of socks, to the value of £5 8s. 9d. He then asked if I would take a cheque for the amount. I said I would inquire to see if he was known. He then asked for a piece of paper, which I gave him; he wrote on it in my presence, 'Marcus E. Holmes, son of late Rev. C. W. Holmes, Harrow' The paper is produced and marked E. I took it to the counting-house and had some conversation with Mr. Wills, and received certain instructions; I then returned to the prisoner and said we would accept a cheque, provided it was for the amount of the goods purchased. He then wrote out in my presence the cheque produced, marked F, for £5 8s. 9d., which I took and gave to the cashier. I made out the bill in duplicate; both are now produced, marked G and G. 1. I asked to what address the goods should be sent. He said his brother was in a cab outside waiting for him and he would take them—I went with him to the door and handed him the goods. I did not see a cab outside; I did not see what became of the prisoner. When I took the cheque I believed it to be a valid one, or I would not have parted with the goods.</p>

I was on duty in Broadway, Westminster, on the morning of 7th February, and I saw the prisoner in the doorway of 2, Chapel street, just about to enter—when he heard my footsteps he pulled a key out of the keyhole of the door and put it into his pocket; it made a jingling noise, as if it fell on more keys—I went across, and asked him if he lived there; he said no, he lived in Great Pier Street; I asked him what he was doing—he said, "Going to make water"—I said, "You don't want latchkeys for that; you have more keys on you—he said, "No; I have only got a book"—he pulled a book out—I said, "Let me feel"—he put his hand in, and brought out two latchkeys—I said, "I shall have to take you to the police-station"—I searched him there, and found these three other keys in his coat-pocket, and this bicycle-spanner, owned by the prosecutor—the inspector went back with me to the house, and one of the first two latchkeys which the</p>

I could get him to take nothing but milk and brandy and my breast. I tried several things, but the child retched, and would not take it. I had him in my hands and arms night and day from Christmas Day. I had a glass of beer, but not sufficient to cause me to neglect my baby; I am too fond of him. I was not intoxicated on Christmas Day; the day the Inspector came I had not been drinking; I could not open the window as the baby was ill; that is why the room smelt My drinking habits have been greatly exaggerated by every witness." <hi rend="italic">In her defence she repeated the same in substance.</hi>

I am barman at the Northampton Arms, Goswell Road, Clerkenwell—on Monday afternoon, 8th February, the prisoner was in that house with some friends—he followed four females in the same bar—I served the females with a pot of four half; the prisoner asked Coppard to treat him; the deceased asked the prisoner what he was imposing on his friend for; the prisoner asked what that had to do with him; the deceased said he would knock his * * * face in; the prisoner said he did not want to fight, or anything to do with him, and went out to the corner of Spencer Street; deceased followed—I saw the prisoner through the window—he returned inside, the deceased followed, showed fight and struck him two or three times, and they fought—I got over the bar and between the two, and told them they must go outside, and they went quietly—outside the prisoner struck the deceased two or three times in the face—the deceased dropped—he did not do anything outside, he seemed a bit dazed—a policeman came and took him in a cab to the hospital.</p>

I was on duty on Monday, 8th February, at the corner of Spencer Street and Goswell Road—I saw the prisoner and several others leave the side door of the Northampton Arms; one man fell—I saw no blow struck then—I saw the prisoner in a fighting attitude—I went up and said, "No fighting allowed here, please," and got the prisoner and his friend away—the prisoner was sparring up to someone else after the man had fallen, but I was some distance off them—the deceased was lifted by his friends into a kneeling position—I found him insensible; I thought he was in a fit, and unbuttoned his clothes—I then called a cab and conveyed him to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where he was seen by the surgeon, who pronounced life extinct.</p>

The prisoner was brought into the station on the night of 11th February—I was present when the charge was entered of causing the death of John O'Connell whilst engaged in a fight—after the charge had been entered and I had read it over to him, and cautioned him, he made this statement, which I took down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189203070045"/>
               <p>in writing, and he signed it: "I went into the public-house, and was. having a glass of ale with a couple of friends. This man, Coppard, who I had not seen for a long time, asked me how I was getting on; I said, 'Middling, 'or something to that effect. This young man who unfortunately met with the accident"—that means the deceased—"said I was taking a liberty. I told him I had known him a considerable time, and it was no business of his; I knew the man as well as he did. I appealed to Coppard as to whether I had not known him. The man said he would like to screw my neck. I said I did not want a row with him. I went out, and on coming back into the public-house I met both of them, O'Connell and Coppard. The man who is dead would insist upon making me fight, and to avoid it I went into the public-house, and had a scrimmage inside, and we were put out. When outside he asked me to take my coat off, but I refused, as I thought he was too good for me, he being a younger and stronger man than I am. When I saw there was no getting out of it I did the best I could for self-protection. If there had been any means of avoiding the fight I should have done so. He hit me and I hit him, I cannot say who struck first, and he went on his knees. Some women came up and tried to claw my face. A policeman came up and turned me away, or I should get into trouble among the lot of them. I waited a considerable time before going away, five or six minutes, as I had nothing to fear. I saw a cab come up, and then I went away. This evening (12th) I went to Mr. Daniels to inquire if I was wanted or not and soon afterwards I was arrested. I would rather have been arrested at the time.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 57, Rye Lane—I attended the prisoner in her confinement, on 19th November last, of a female child—I visited her for ten weeks—during that time the child was perfectly healthy—the fourth day after the child was born, when I arrived at the house, I found her sitting up dressed—she had five other children—the consequence of her getting up was that her milk had left her—she afterwards brought the child for my advice—it was in a weakly condition, and she said she did not think it was getting on—I cannot say it was clean—she said she had been feeding it on oatmeal—that was very improper food—I told her so, and to give it cow's milk and barley water sweetened with sugar—she brought the child again in about three weeks—it was more weakly—she said she had done as I told her—I did not think it was being properly fed—on 24th February I was called in, and found the child dead—I made a post-mortem examination the following Saturday—the weight of the body was 3 lb. 15 oz.—the normal weight of a child that age would be nearly 10 lb., the average weight of a child three months old is 9. 6lb.—I found no indication of any organic disease—in the stomach I found a very small quantity of milky fluid, about a teaspoonful, about a drachm—the intestines were contracted, and the walls very thin—that led me to the conclusion the child had not sufficient food—I am of opinion the child would have taken food if it had it—it had the power to take food—if it had not been able to assimilate</p>

I am the wife of William Gardner, of 33, Dorset Place, Pimlico—on February 7th, about 12.30 a.m., I was with my husband in Besborough Gardens, Pimlico, and saw the prisoner Ashby standing tinder the railings—I did not know her before—she flew at me and tore the boa from my neck, and tried to pull my hand-bag away, and gave me a blow on my face and a black eye—my husband came to my assistance, and four or five men surrounded him and robbed him.</p>

R. Johnson—half an hour afterwards he came back and gave me £12 in gold for the cheque—after that another man came with the cheque, and said something to me which I repeated to the prisoner next morning; it was that he had been round the neighbourhood trying to change my cheque—I gave him the money for it, saying I did not like my cheque being hawked round the neighbourhood—I told that to Pauncefort the next morning—about an hour afterwards, about six in the evening, I saw the horse and trap outside my house, and in Pauncefort's presence I said it was a decent little lot, or something like that—he said it came from a widow at Stamford Hill who kept a dairy.</p>

               <p>of the 17th—Pauncefort took me to his house, and I there found two sewing machines, which are the subject of other charges, No. 8367933, Mortlock has pleaded guilty to that, and 10623823, Mrs. Somerville's—I found in the mews another horse and trap belonging to Adams; the horse was working—Pauncefort gave me four pawn-tickets relating to sewing machines, which he said he had bought from Johnson—they were pledged for £1 4s., £1, £1 10s., and £2—I believe they average about £6 each in value; some are Singer's and some Bradbury's—Pauncefort gave £1 5s. for the seven pawn-tickets—he is a cab proprietor—I never knew him to be a dealer in general goods in this way; I cannot say if he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Pauncefort made the following statement, which I took down in writing:—"On or about the end of January, 1892, I saw a young man outside the, Oliver public-house. He was with a man named Kennedy, a cabman. He offered me a pawn-ticket for sale, and left it with me to go and see it. It was for a sewing machine, pledged at a pawnbroker's at Chapel Street or Church Street, Edgware Road. I gave him 5s. for it. About three or four days after I saw him again, with Mortlock, on Sunday, 30th ult., at the Green Man public-house, Harlesden, at 7 p.m. He asked Mrs. Cakebread if I was there, and I came out. He said, 'My <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> (meaning Mortlock) has the brokers in, and wants to sell this pony and trap, and said he wanted £9 for it. 'I looked at it, and saw the pony was in good condition, but overdriven, and thought she was a kicker, and offered him £6 for the lot, and he (meaning Mortlock) took it. The other man was with him at the time. Clement Cakebread saw me pay for it. They had drink afterwards, and left about 7.30 p.m. About Monday or Tuesday following I saw the younger man, whom I knew as Johnson, outside the Oliver, in Harrow Road. He had a bay cob, about 14 hands 2 inches, chip-kneed, off-hind fetlock white and scared fetlock joints, in poor condition; white metal harness, and small well trap, painted dark, picked out black, dashboard broken in front, off hind wheel damaged in stock. He asked me to purchase it, saying he wished to sell it for a widow at Stamford Hill, and she wished £15 for it. I looked at it, and thought it would be worth £12, and offered that for it. He took £12 15s. for it I gave a cheque for £12, and 15s. silver, I spoke to him about Mortlock. He said he put him in a cab at the Stafford public-house, and gave him eight shillings to take him home. I obtained the cheque from Mr. Francis, the landlord of the Oliver, Westbourne Terrace North. After having drunk we left. I saw him again about a day or two after at the Oliver, and he spoke to me and asked me if I had fetched the machines. I said yes. He came to my house and showed Mrs. Rouse, my landlady, how to work them. He gave me four more tickets for machines. I gave him £1 for the lot, and I have not seen him since. Mortlock came to-day with two men, and I identified him as the man I bought the pony from at Harlesden, and he was given into custody by me"—he signed that—he came back with Mortlock—I have heard that he went with a potman to look for Mortlock, and he brought him back—he gave me the information about the pawn-tickets, and gave them to me—I have heard that two horses got out of Pauncefort's stable, and one of them had been sold to him by Mortlock—Pauncefort gave a full description at the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If Pauncefort had not given me information about the tickets I should have searched for things in his house after he was in custody—he took the tickets from a vase on the mantelpiece in his room, and the machines were in his room.</p>

Up to 28th May last I was a piano manufacturer; and for ten years before that I had numerous transactions with the prisoner—on 28th May I failed—at that time I owed Keogh between £400 and £500—on his failure he owed me about £1,000, I think—I have received no portion of that—it was owing in respect of transactions in organs and pianos, which I have let him have from time to time—I believe Mr. Steinwitz is a pianoforte maker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a postman, in the employ of Her Majesty's Postmaster-General, and live at 25, Hazelwood Crescent, Westbourne Park—I have known Jeffreys since 1841, and have seen him in possession of Sandwich Islands stamps; he told me he got them from Ponsford and Co.—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are "the Sandwich Islands stamps; they all have what appear to be postmarks on them, and are gummed to some paper—they are perforated—when I first saw them in Jeffreys' possession they were not gummed, perforated, or post-marked—I saw him gum and perforate some of them—I have never sold any of these stamps; I received some of them from Jeffreys, I did not purchase them; I had lent him £3, and he told me I might have them and sell them to get my money back—I did not sell them myself, but through others to Sidney Swann, and not more than half a dozen to Mr. Buhl—I sold from fifty to a hundred, and got about £5 or £6 for them—there is no value attached to them—no such stamp ever existed in the Sandwich Islands as far as I know—I afterwards saw Mr. Buhl, and returned him some of the money he had paid for them, and I procured some of the stamps without a post-mark and gave them to him—I have been to Jeffreys house, 80, Grove Road, Bow, about four times; in 1886 or 1887, and saw him put a surcharge on some Costa Rica stamps with a small printers press and type—I have known Benjamin and Sarpy about the same time, and saw them together at one time in the same year very frequently—I have sold stamps for them which were genuine to the best of my belief; I do not suppose they, were always genuine—I sold them to Mr. Buhl and others—I met Jeffreys and Benjamin in 1889 in Benjamin and Sarpy's shop, 1, Cullum Street; he showed me some Tasmanian stamps, and said that they were the latest—I said that they were very good forgeries—I saw Sarpy put a fourpenny surcharge on a Grenada fiscal stamp in his shop—he did it with a small metal die; Benjamin was in the shop—I have seen perforating machines there; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are three of them, and I sold them a small printing press, No. 1 Model, large enough for printing visiting cards or stamps.</p>

The firm had these Sandwich Islands transactions with Jeffreys about August, 1886; I was three days or a week dealing with the stamps—there is no such stamp as this—the Sandwich Islands stamp is nothing at all like it, either in size or impression—I saw the original pen-and-ink sketch on paper from which these stamps were made before the stamps were printed; Jeffreys showed it to me and told me he had got them printed, so that I knew perfectly well that they were not genuine—I did not sell it as genuine—I gave no warranty with the stamps I sold—I sold some other <hi rend="italic">faked</hi> stamps knowing that they were <hi rend="italic">faked</hi>, but if the people asked me if they were genuine I should have told them no—I let them rely on their own judgment—I made a little collection—there are a great number of <hi rend="italic">fakes;</hi> the proper term is <hi rend="italic">fac similes</hi> I also know that there are reprints; the process I saw at Jeffreys' was</p>

This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the press I sold to Sarpy; it is broken now, as it was when I sold it—it would not stand much use in the state it is in; it would become worse—I have taken an interest in collecting stamps since 1886—I got into the service of the Post Office in 1890, and have been in their service nearly two years—I was an office boy in Threadneedle Street when I first began to take an interest in stamps—after that I was steward on board a boat, and occasionally in the employ of the Post Office, and eventually altogether—a great many lads of twelve to sixteen sell stamps, and people do a considerable trade in it—there are a great many stamps which are not genuine—I knew Jeffreys by the name of the <hi rend="italic">faker</hi> before I became acquainted with him, sometime before 1886; I cannot say whether it was so far back as 1891—I knew he produced stamps which were not genuine—I first saw Benjamin in the Stamp Market, Bell Alley, London—that is a place where all the boys congregate to buy and sell stamps—a dozen or more would congregate there when Benjamin was round—I have seen other persons buy besides Benjamin—the last time I sold stamps was to Benjamin and Bannister—I cannot bring to memory selling any for Benjamin and Sarpy—I only knew the firm as Benjamin, but I knew Sarpy at that time—I sold one large lot of genuine stamps for Benjamin and Bannister—the majority, if not all, were genuine—Mr. Buhl never complained, he never came to me in that transaction at all—I never heard that any of those I sold were not genuine—a lot of people buy <hi rend="italic">fakes</hi> knowing them to be such—I heard Mr. Phillips say that there are people who possess albums full of stamps which do not profess to be genuine—there always were a lot of dealers who bought stamps knowing they were wrong, and I have bought some myself—the Sydney View is a very pretty stamp; it gives a view of the bay—;<hi rend="italic">fake</hi> stamps are sold for a small price compared with the genuine—there are stamps so rare that only two or three of them are in existence, but I have never seen them—I believe that when the genuine stamp cannot be obtained people frequently buy <hi rend="italic">a fake</hi> stamp.</p>

K. Jeffreys, 80, Victoria Park Road—the engraving was to be £3 15s., and the printing £1 9s.—I executed the order; I forget whether it was delivered or called for—the stamps produced are what I engraved—when they left my premises they were not marked in this way; they were in a large sheet, but not perforated or gummed—I did not know for what purpose they were intended.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in foreign stamps, and have traded under the name of Lester, 101, Green's Road—I first knew Benjamin about six years ago, and Jeffreys and Sarpy five years ago—I was at Jeffreys' house and saw him surcharge some stamps of the Argentine Republic—he stamped them with the word "official"—I may have had a dozen, or perhaps two dozen, after he had surcharged them—I showed them to various dealers; I don't remember the result; I did not want them, hut he forced them on me—he gave them to me in exchange—he gave me a piece of paper with surcharges on it; he termed them the faker's pride—I should say they were very good, and very likely to deceive; likely to be taken for genuine—I saw him frequently at Benjamin and Sarpy's business premises at Cullum Street, and soon after Benjamin returned from Australia in 1888, and I once met Jeffreys in Bishopsgate Street—Benjamin was nearly always at Cullum Street when I saw Jeffreys there; and during the latter part of the time, 1890 and 1891, Sarpy has been there—the three always transacted their business at the back, and we had to go out; I was outside, but not on all occasions—I have seen money pass, principally on Saturdays, in 1889 and 1890—in 1890 Benjamin said he was going to <hi rend="italic">fake</hi> forgeries, and there was plenty of money to be got out of it—he told me once that he and Sarpy had been at Jeffreys' house all night surcharging stamps—I have sold stamps for Benjamin and Sarpy since his return from Australia down to six months back; they were mostly forgeries—they were good imitations—I sold some as forgeries to Mr. Buhl; he was my principal customer; I sold them nearly all to him, saying what they were—I sold the others to dealers since this case began; they, of course, would sell again—I remember selling Mr. Buhl a forged stamp as a genuine one once by accident, and once by design—I got the full value, and nothing was said; I simply sold it for 3s.—in all other cases I told him they were forgeries—in the other instance the Mump was given by Benjamin as genuine—the stamps I sold to dealers were such good imitations that they would deceive dealers—I once took</p>

               <p>some fiscal stamps to Jeffreys, and asked him to clean them, meaning to remove the ink marks; he said he had not been doing anything in that line lately, it was trifling business and lie had better things than that—I asked him how to clean them; he said he could tell me if I did not mention it to any one, and wrote out on a bit of paper the description how to clean various coloured stamps, and gave it to me—the stamps were all of low value; he asked if I had any £5 or £10 stamps to let him have them in exchange for the receipt for cleaning, which I kept—this is it (<hi rend="italic">This mentioned salts of lemon and other chemicals</hi>); he said that the four articles at the bottom were the principal acids he used.</p>

I got that at Jeffreys' house on Sunday, November 22nd, 1891—that was the second time I had been there—I had not made au appointment to go there—I was in communication at that time with Detective Mozer, as regards the prosecution—I went there to collect evidence, not as a spy—I gave the document to Mozer the following day—I kept it twelve hours—no one else was present when he gave it to me—I said nothing before the Magistrate about his asking me for some higher value stamps in return, but I told Mr. Mozer—I did not ask him on my first visit to put this surcharge on—I had from ten to twenty-four of these—that is the only transaction I had with Jeffreys—I mean to say that I saw Sarpy in Jeffreys' shop in 1891; we have played at cards together after business hours in 1890, but not in 1891.</p>

I have done business in the City as a stamp-dealer six and a half years—I have no office; I go to my father's office, Bury Court, St. Mary Axe—I buy stamps from housekeepers and waste-paper dealers—I do my business at home—I have several customers at the Exchange in the street—I do my business in the street—I buy them, and take them away with me and sell them to dealers—I bought a lot hero last night—I have no other business—I know the principal dealers in the City and West-end—I have known for a good many years that stamps are being sold which are not genuine—I know the term "<hi rend="italic">fake</hi>"; it means stamps which are not genuine—I have only bought stamps of Benjamin and Sarpy on two or three occasions, and quite recently; the first time was about seven or eight months ago—I know they have been dealing for some time in stamps which are not genuine; Benjamin did so a few months after I knew him, five and a half years ago—I first went to 1, Cullum Street when Benjamin returned from Australia in 1888—I knew Benjamin and Bannister, but that was not at Cullum Street—I first visited Benjamin in Leathersellers' Buildings and Bell Alley about six years ago; I did not know then that he dealt in stamps which were not genuine, but I knew it a few months afterwards—I visited him almost every day down to his coming to Cullum Street, but the first time I bought any of him was about seven months ago—I actually sold him my stamps four or five years before I bought any of him, and I knew the whole of the time that ho dealt in stamps which wore not genuine—since his return, in 1888, I have seen him do the work which made them pass as if they were real—I did not see them in his shop, but I knew he dealt in them by being told so by people—we all used to go to a public-house together and play at billiards, and I learned the fact from conversations in his place—certain people who dealt in forgeries were present—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk out of employment—in 1891 I was in the employ of Mr. Hart, a stamp dealer in London—Jeffreys called on him, and I heard a conversation in reference to some Sydney View stamps, which Hart bought at 3s. each; a genuine one is worth 20s. to 30s.—Jeffreys said he had sold Benjamin a quantity of them, and we were not to say anything about it, as he had told Benjamin he would not sell any within a certain period—that was in June, 1891—I saw Jeffreys two or three days later at his house, 80, Grove Road. Bow, and asked him to bring some more Sydney Views for Mr. Hart—he was in his shirt-sleeves, and said he was engraving a die, and just left off to see me—he had a graving tool in his hand—he showed me some impressions from a die for an eightpenny Ceylon stamp and two pieces of star water-mark paper—he said that Benjamin and Hart had agreed to go partners in the profit, but, having fallen out, Jeffreys had to pay for the whole of the papers—he did not show me the die; he said he did not</p>

The star water-mark paper was a foot square—I have not seen other pieces that size before—I do not know how wide apart the stars were—this was in the evening—I went down for Jeffreys to call on Mr. Hart I do not know whether Hart is in this country—I have sold <hi rend="italic">fakes</hi>, both in this country and abroad; I sold them as genuine on the Continent, but not in this country—the imperfect eightpenny Ceylon impression was on cardboard, I think—the head was in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. I have known Benjamin about seven years, and Sarpy three or four years—about two years ago I saw a card of their business, which said that they sold <hi rend="italic">fakes</hi> of all descriptions—I also saw a 1s. 9d. Ceylon stamp, and a blue Tasmanian—Mr. Hart bought one, but they were not well enough executed to take people in—I have seen, perhaps, 100 Queensland stamps not genuine—they came from Mr. Hart; who got them from an <hi rend="italic">employ</hi>é of the Bank of Queensland—Mr. Hart cleaned and marked some New Zealand stamps—the business has been going on about three years—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Benjamin and Sarpy's card, which I saw two years ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not make a very accurate observation of the card—it said, <hi rend="italic">"Fakes</hi> of all descriptions Supplied on the shortest notice, or something of that kind—the eightpenny Ceylon stamp was not finished, he was in the course of engraving it—the man at the Bank of Queensland did not supply them, with any knowledge of forgery—first of all Jefferys supplied Mr. Hart with stamps which were known to be forged—I had some stamps from Benjamin and Sarpy; they were forgeries, and known to be such—the stamps supplied by the <hi rend="italic">employ</hi>é of the Queensland Bank were half-crown, ten shillings, and one pound postal and fiscal—they were perfectly genuine—besides the three prisoners a man named Bannister supplied forged stamps to Mr. Bart, who bought them and sold them to collectors as genuine.</p>

I am a stationer, bookseller, and dealer in stamps, at the Arcade, Bournemouth—about 23rd November, 1891, I called at Cullum Street, and bought some stamps from Benjamin, for about £2, as genuine—I took them to Bournemouth—next morning I examined them critically—I found a twelve kreutzer adhesive Bavarian was a forgery—I had paid 6s. 6d. for it—I paid for them separately—I sent it to Mr. Phillips by post—on the 23rd November I saw some stamps in Benjamin's shop window—that or the next time I saw a V. R. English—I do not think there was more than a week between my two visits—the label I saw attached to it was "Rare V.

K. Taplin, which he left to the nation, the finest collection in this country, and worth about £30,000—I have examined the stamps produced—the Sandwich Islands postage stamps are bogus; no such design was ever issued—it is a stamp that has been made to defraud people—it is not genuine—the postmarks are forgeries the surcharge enhances the value of stamps sometimes—a postal mark up on a fiscal stamp would enhance its value, and perforating; sometimes rouletting—it would make them rare—perforating was invented about 1864—the 1s. 9d. green Ceylon stamp is a distinct forgery—it purports to have been used—all these twelve produced on this sheet have an obliteration upon them—I could see a great many more in the parcel—the 8d. brown Ceylon is a forgery—the one I have is not used—there is no substantial difference between the forged and the genuine—the unused 9d. stamp is a forgery—the Ceylon 4d. and 2s. are forged—both are unused—the New Zealand Stamps are genuine—I have not yet examined the postmarks—the Ceylon 4d. perforated would be worth about £8; the 8d. one would range from £8 or £9 downwards to 30s., and the 1s. 9d. and 2s. about the same—as they are they are valueless—I have not examined the 18 kreutzer Baden—I find an envelope with a large number of 12 kreutzer Bavarian stamps in the Oval Road portion; that was originally on a 12 kreutzer money order card—it has been converted into an adhesive postage stamp—the postmark on it is a forgery, its value would be some few pounds, in its present condition several shillings—15s. if genuine—I say the same with regard to the other samples, they are valueless in the condition they are—the Sydney Views are very good forgeries, and likely to deceive the postal authorities—I believe they could be used for letters in Australia—they have not been withdrawn, and could be used for postal purposes—there are about 160 Victoria blue 1s. stamps in the Oval Road parcel—I produce samples of the perforated and unperforated—they are forgeries—some are used and some unused—the anna stamps are genuine, but the postmarks are forged, and the surcharges, consisting of the words "Service, Postage" the 8-anna without the surcharge is worth 1d. or 2d„ with it £8 or £9; the 4-anna the same and £6, the 2-anna the same and £2 to £3—I found six used Sydney Views in the envelope left in the cab, 70 to 80 in Oval Road parcel, and two in Cullum Street parcel of 2-annas, one unused in the envelope and one in the Oval Eoad parcel; of the four annas one in the envelope unused, two used in the Oval Road parcel; the 8-annas are unused, and seven or eight used in the Oval Eoad parcel; the Victoria 1s. blue, two unperforated and two perforated, all unused in the envelope; over 100 used unperforated and 60 used perforated in the Oval Road parcel; the 1s. 9d. green Ceylon, three unused in the envelope, and over forty used in the Oval parcel—there were many other false stamps.</p>

White, Esq., Victoria Station, London, Chatham and Dover Railway, S. W., and gave it to Miss Knight, who called on me that afternoon, to post—receiving no receipt, I wrote to Mr. White, and then received a communication from him, and upon the 14th I wrote to the bank to stop the cheque—they wrote back to mo. enclosing this cheque.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Lettis Street, Fulham—I am employed in the solicitor's department of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company at Victoria Station—I have known the prisoner by sight for some years—towards the end of the first week in January, to the best of my recollection, I cannot fix the day, I was going out of my office door at Victoria Station, and I saw the prisoner standing at the adjoining private door of the office of Mr. Morgan, the solicitor to the Company—I was going past where he was standing, but I did not wish to speak to him, and I turned to go the other way; he called out to me; I stopped—he came up and said he should like to say a few words to me—I showed him into my office, and we stood talking in front of the fire—Mr. J. W. C. White works in the same office in which I work, and into which I took the prisoner—there is a table there set apart for J. W. C. White—on that table his letters would be placed in the morning in the ordinary course, and would stay there for perhaps one or two days if Mr. White did not come up, and then they would be posted to him—on this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189203070091"/>
               <p>day Mr. White was not up; his table was covered with a duster the whole day; he had been ill for some time—Tonkin appeared to be exhausted and sat down on Mr. White's chair, which was in front of Mr. White's table, for ten or fifteen minutes—to the best of my recollection there were two or three letters on the table, but I won't be positive about it—I did not see him take anything off the table—he could have taken anything off without my seeing him; he was sitting sideways on the chair, so that one elbow would come across the writing-desk on the table, and one arm was resting on the desk, and his hand was playing on the table, or resting on the slope; I was standing in front of the fire looking at right angles to him; so that I should not have noticed particularly what was going on—after ten or fifteen minutes he left, and that was the last I saw of him—if he came to the office in the ordinary way by coming to the ordinary office, his name should have been entered in the call-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am an admitted solicitor—this is not a prosecution by the Company—the office consists of three rooms, each opening into a corridor; one of the rooms opens into another; but the third has only one entrance—there is a lavatory at the end of the corridor—there is a spiral staircase up to the offices which are on the first floor, and also an ordinary staircase at the other end of the corridor—there are ten clerks and office boys employed altogether, five in one room and five in the other—among the gentlemen who work there is the solicitor for this prosecution—Mr. Morgan has been solicitor to the Company for about six months—he is the head of the office—I have had a good deal to do with him, and know his handwriting very well—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are written by him—Mr. John White, not Mr. J. W. C. White, was Mr. Morgan's predecessor—after he died the pigeon holes and drawers in his office were sealed and red-taped; I presume that was during, a sort of interregnum, before his successor was appointed—I cannot say that it was on account of the insecurity of the office—the prisoner did not tell me he wanted to see Mr. Morgan—I do not think he brought a deed with him—he showed me a judgment summons—he was not altogether a stranger to me—I had seen him before, on business connected with Mr. Morgan—I know he has claimed, during the last week or so, £600 from Mr. Morgan—I do not see Mr. Morgan here—the prisoner says now he claims £600 from Mr. Morgan for money he lent to Mr. Morgan when Mr. Morgan was in a comparatively humble position—I am prepared to swear this was the early part of January—I will not swear it was not 6th January, or before 6th January—I will swear it was not 10th January, because the cheque was shown to me on 15th, and that brought the matter to my mind; not in connection with the prisoner, but on 20th the prisoner's name turned up, and that took me back to the 15th, and the 15th took me back to, roughly, the number of days before it—I think Mr. Swabrick showed me the cheque on 15th—I don't know if the cheque was shown to Mr. Morgan—I believe Mr. Morgan was in his office on the day I saw the prisoner; I don't know whether he was there at the time the prisoner was there.

I am manager of the New Cross Branch of the London and South-Western Bank—on 8th January, between twelve and a quarter to one, a man, who, to the best of my belief, is the prisoner, gave me across the counter a cheque for £8 10s. drawn by Miss Gibbs—had seen him ten years ago when he dealt with our Sydenham Branch—I saw him there whenever he came in—I cannot say that it was pretty constantly—when he came in on the 8th I said, "Good morning"—he said, "Good morning! do you know me?"—I said, "Yes, Mr. Tonkin of Sydenham, you used to bank with us ten years ago"—he seemed rather surprised; he said, "No, my name is White, I have come to present this cheque," and he presented this cheque which was endorsed J. W. C. White—there was some little delay in cashing it, owing to our cashier being downstairs—while he was being called I apologised to the prisoner for having called him Mr. Tonkin, but at the same time I said he was remarkably like him—when he received the money he said, "By-the-bye I seem to know you from somewhere, but I cannot tell you where—he got the money and left the bank—I next saw him on 6th February in the main line booking office at Victoria Station, and I identified him then as the man who had cashed the cheque on the 8th January—the signatures to these cheques are those of the Tonkin I used to know at Sydenham, and whom I identify as the prisoner.</p>

               <p>what he would be charged with—he said, "It is a mistake, it is a grand mistake"—I took him to the station—I found on him 8s. 1 1/2 d., a 25 cent note, a pocket-knife, umbrella, rule, three pocket handkerchiefs, and five memoranda, which he said were in his handwriting—when charged at the station he pointed to the prosecutrix and said, "I never saw that lady before, did you say on 24th or 28th? I don't know nothing at all about it, can I have bail?"—afterwards I went to his house and saw his son, who gave me these fourteen cheques and three memoranda—I showed the cheques to the prisoner on the 14th, at the Police-court; he said, "They are my cheques, my signature, and my writing."</p>

I live at 12, Jutland Road, Brown Hill Road, Catford—I am a driver on the South-Eastern Metropolitan Tramways Company—at ten o'clock on 8th January, I and Inspector Stansfield went to Mr. Pook's, a solicitor in Greenwich, in consequence of an action against the tram company, in which we were concerned—we saw Mr. Pook's clerk and the prisoner—he said good morning to me and Stansfield—we were together in the office about five or ten minutes—I and Stansfield went there again at twelve o'clock—I saw the prisoner again that day at 12.40 sitting in the corner of the tramcar at Blackheath Hill, about five minutes' walk from the County Court—it was a car going to Catford—I got on at the bar of the car and noticed him—I went on the top—I went to Catford terminus—we got there at two or three minutes after one—the prisoner got out there—from 12.40 to two or three minutes after one the prisoner was in that car—I had seen him before that day; he is a regular rider up and down on the cars—I remember the day, because of going to Pook's office.</p>
