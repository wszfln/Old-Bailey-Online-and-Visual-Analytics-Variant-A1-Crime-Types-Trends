    <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This project, "Old Bailey Online and Visual Analytics - Variant A1: Exploring Crime Types & Trends (1674-1913)", 
      aims to systematically study the criminal trial records on the website of the Central Criminal Court in London 
      (Old Bailey) from 1674 to 1913 by using data science and visual analysis techniques. Through the analysis and 
      visualization of historical crime data, the project not only hopes to reveal the evolution trend of different 
      types of crimes in the past 240 years, but also attempts to explore the social, legal, economic and technological 
      changes reflected behind them, and finally build an interactive web visual analysis platform to provide new historical 
      data to the public, researchers and policy makers.
